80TH INTEGRATED ANNUAL
REPORT 2024-25

Our Founder

Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata
03.03.1839 – 19.05.1904

In a free enterprise, the community is not just
another stakeholder in business, but is in fact
the very purpose of its existence.

In Remembrance

Padma Vibhushan

Ratan N Tata

28.12.1937 – 09.10.2024
It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata,
a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not
only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation.
For the Tata Group, Mr. Tata was more than a chairperson. He inspired by
example. With an unwavering commitment to excellence, integrity and
innovation, the Tata Group under his stewardship expanded its global footprint
while always remaining true to its moral compass.
Mr. Tata’s dedication to philanthropy and the development of society has
touched the lives of millions. From education to healthcare, his initiatives have
left a deep‑rooted mark that will benefit generations to come. Reinforcing all of
this mark was Mr. Tata’s genuine humility in every individual interaction.
His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles
he so passionately championed.

New Paths
Newer Aspirations
At Tata Motors, we are stepping into a new era — one  defined by
sharper focus, greater agility, and bold ambition.
Our forthcoming demerger marks a pivotal transformation: forming two
independent, publicly listed companies — one dedicated to personal
mobility, including Passenger Vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover, and the
other focused on commercial mobility solutions.
This move enables each entity to pursue distinct strategies, drive
purposeful innovation, and respond swiftly to evolving market dynamics.
With dedicated leadership and a clear strategic mandate, both
businesses are better positioned to strengthen market presence, unlock
new growth opportunities, and deliver sustained value while continuing
our legacy of safety, reliability, and sustainability.
For our stakeholders, this evolution is more than a structural change
— it is a reaffirmation of our commitment to long-term value creation,
deeper customer trust, and shaping the future of mobility.

As we chart new paths, we do so with renewed
aspirations — to lead with clarity, perform with excellence,
and deliver a safer, smarter, and greener tomorrow.

Chairman’s message

N Chandrasekaran

Chairman and Non‑Executive Director

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present the
Integrated Annual Report of
Tata Motors Limited for FY25,
marking the 80th year of your
Company’s journey.
This was the year we lost Mr. Ratan
Tata, whose vision made Tata Motors
what it is today. We remain inspired
by his contributions.
The year 2025 began with optimism,
underpinned by expectations of
macroeconomic stability and recovery
with global growth, falling inflation,
and tailwinds from falling interest
rates. However, this macro narrative
shifted with rising concerns around
global growth and inflation as policy
uncertainty rose sharply with dramatic
shifts in trade policy. Amid trade
uncertainties, global growth is
expected to slow to 2.3% in 2025
from 2.8% in 2024.
In this challenging landscape, the
long-term structural shifts that I have
referred to earlier, transition to cleaner
and greener energy, deepening digital
transformation, and reconfiguration
of global supply chains, continue to
move forward.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Across all these shifts, one stands
apart: the potential of Artificial
Intelligence (AI)/Generative AI
(Gen AI). This is not merely another
technological shift; it is a civilisational
one. AI is swiftly becoming as
fundamental to human progress
as electricity once was, reshaping
our world in ways we are only
beginning to comprehend. It’s being
supercharged by parallel progress in
semiconductors, cloud computing,
quantum technologies, robotics,
energy innovations and innovations
in energy storage. What makes
this moment uniquely significant
is its simultaneity. Unlike previous
technological revolutions that arrived
sequentially across the globe, AI/
Gen AI is emerging simultaneously
everywhere and impacting the pace
of change of other technologies.
For Tata Motors, AI/Gen AI presents
huge opportunities in all aspects of the
business, including how vehicles are
conceived, how they are built and how
they operate on the road. AI in vehicles
is improving safety, increasing fuel
efficiency, and providing drivers with
enhanced connectivity features. This is
the new context in which we craft our
strategies for the future.

In this context, I am pleased to share
that your Company made steady
progress in FY25, navigating a complex
operating environment with agility
and focus, enabling consistent
progress across our portfolio while
reinforcing the foundations of
a resilient, customer-centric, and
future‑ready organisation.
While performance varied across
segments, each of our automotive
businesses — Commercial Vehicles (CV),
Passenger Vehicles (PV), and Jaguar Land
Rover (JLR), remained aligned to their
strategic priorities and demonstrated
tangible progress across key areas.
Your Company successfully addressed
several challenges during the year,
including geopolitical turbulence,
challenges with global supply chains,
and a fluctuating demand for autos in
certain markets.
On a consolidated basis, the business
delivered several key milestones,
including record high revenue of
I4,39,695 crore, EBITDA of I57,649
crore, and record high PBT (before
exceptional items) of I34,330 crore
leading to the group becoming debt
free this year.

06

The proposed demerger will bring greater
strategic clarity and agility, enabling a more
focused approach to execution and value
creation, delivering superior experiences for
customers, rewarding careers for employees,
and long-term returns for shareholders.

The Board has recommended a final
dividend of I6/- per ordinary share for
FY25, subject to your approval.
I would now like to outline the
opportunities ahead and the key
imperatives for each of our businesses.

Commercial Vehicles

Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles has
successfully restructured the business
into eight distinct verticals, enhancing
strategic focus and alignment and
enabling sharper performance delivery.
Despite industry headwinds, the
business gained market share and
improved realisations in both Trucks
and Buses. The performance of Small
Commercial Vehicles and Pickups is
still not at desired levels, and we are
working to address it with speed.
The Non-Vehicular segment continued
its strong momentum, driven by
growth in spares, services, and
emerging verticals. Initiatives to
enhance dealer profitability have
yielded tangible results, reflected in
improved satisfaction scores across
the network.
Our Electric Mobility portfolio scaled
meaningfully, with Smart City Mobility

07

INTEGRATED
REPORT

deploying over 3,600 electric buses
while maintaining high uptime.
The planned integration with the CV
Passenger business is expected to
unlock synergies and drive further
expansion and innovation in public
and private mobility solutions.
Digital platforms such as Fleet Edge and
Fleet Verse continue to grow in scale
and impact, delivering measurable
value through connected services and
customer-centric offerings.
With a favourable macroeconomic
environment, rising infrastructure
investments, and strong replacement
demand, the commercial vehicle
industry is poised for sustained
growth. Supported by a track record
of operational and financial excellence,
Tata Motors is well-positioned to
capitalise on emerging opportunities.

Passenger and
Electric Vehicles (India)

SUVs and CNG vehicles helped
achieve key milestones in cumulative
PV and EV sales. Driven by a robust
multi‑powertrain strategy and
a deep‑rooted commitment to
sustainable mobility, we grew the share
of CNG and electric vehicles to 36% of
our overall portfolio.
We commenced work on our new
manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu,
laying the foundation for future
growth. At the same time, we scaled
our nationwide infrastructure and retail
footprint to accelerate the adoption
of electric vehicles. We also elevated
the end-to-end customer experience
through improved digital, retail, and
after‑sales service interventions.
As we grow, we are also embedding
greater automation and AI into our
operations, enhancing agility and
efficiency while shaping a future‑ready
manufacturing ecosystem.

The Indian passenger vehicle industry
entered a phase of consolidation
following years of high growth,
with steady demand tempered by
macroeconomic factors.

Chairman’s message

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)

JLR delivered a robust financial
performance and strong operational
progress in FY25.
From a financial results perspective,
the Company delivered consolidated
revenues of  £29  billion, like the
previous year.
The Company achieved its aim of
reaching an adjusted EBIT margin
of 8.5% and recorded a positive net
cash position at the close of the
financial year.
JLR continues to realise its Reimagine
strategy this year, completing works
to transform its UK plants for electric
vehicle production. The ambition is
to have electric versions of all JLR’s
brands by the end of the decade and
be carbon net zero by 2039.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Sustainability:
Core to our purpose

In alignment with the Tata Group’s
‘Aalingana’ initiative, which focuses
on achieving net-zero emissions,
fostering circular economies, and
preserving biodiversity, your Company
is embedding and actively advancing
these principles across its operations.
We have set ambitious targets:
achieving net-zero greenhouse gas
emissions by 2039 for JLR, 2040 for
our passenger vehicles and by 2045
for commercial vehicles, supported
by interim science-based targets
and a commitment to sourcing 100%
renewable electricity by 2030.
The TATVA framework emphasises
circularity through optimised use
of materials, energy, and product
lifecycles. With Re.Wi.Re (Recycle with
Respect), we are enabling responsible
vehicle decommissioning and

recycling, contributing to a sustainable
automotive lifecycle. Through our
collaborative platform called ‘AIKYAM’,
suppliers are being engaged to adopt
sustainable practices across the value
chain. Additionally, flagship biodiversity
projects, supported by active employee
and community participation,
are conserving and promoting
natural ecosystems.
Through these concerted actions,
Tata Motors is leading the
automotive industry’s transition
towards sustainable and responsible
mobility solutions.

Demerger: A strategic leap

To empower each business to pursue
its distinct vision, the demerger of
Tata Motors into two listed entities —
Commercial Vehicles and Passenger
Vehicles (including EV and JLR) — is
progressing as planned. Enabling

08

corporate actions to streamline the
capital structure of the Company and
enhance its operational focus gathered
pace during the year with the successful
delisting of its DVRs and the merger
of Tata Motors Finance Ltd. with
Tata Capital Ltd. In early FY26, your
Company’s shareholders approved
the demerger which is expected to
be effective during the second half
of 2025, with shareholders receiving
equivalent shares in both entities.
The proposed demerger, will bring
greater strategic clarity and agility,
enabling a more focused approach to
execution and value creation, delivering
superior experiences for customers,
rewarding careers for employees, and
long-term returns for shareholders.

09

INTEGRATED
REPORT

Looking ahead

We step into FY26 with confidence in
our strategy, strength in our execution,
and belief in our people. We remain
vigilant to worldwide volatility,
including the impact of changes
in global trade conditions and the
varying degrees of adoption of electric
vehicles across different markets and
evolving technologies, to accelerate
our production plans while delivering
value to our customers. I remain
confident in the future of our brands
and the resilience of our business. Our
focus remains on delivering consistent
growth, enriching customer experience,
and innovating for a cleaner, safer, and
more connected mobility future.

The commitment of our people and
our partners during the year cannot be
overstated. They continued to deliver
the highest standards of care and
innovation for our clients, as well as for
our communities and the environment.
I would like to thank our teams for
their efforts and our partners for
their support.
On behalf of the Board, I thank you for
your continued trust and partnership.
Together, we are moving purposefully
towards a better tomorrow.

Warm Regards,

N Chandrasekaran

we are well‑positioned to
capitalise on the evolving
global economic dynamics,
leveraging India’s economic
growth. Our luxury brands
have global appeal, and
our business is resilient,

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
has projected India’s GDP growth at
6.2% for 2025. This forecast reflects
India’s strong economic fundamentals
and resilience amid global economic
challenges. On the infrastructure front,
India has significantly ramped up its
spending with increased Union budget
allocation. For the fiscal year
2025-26, the Indian government has
set a capital expenditure (capex) target
of I11.21 lakh crore, marking a
10.08% increase from the previous
year’s revised estimate.
The Indian commercial vehicle
industry is expected to maintain its
growth trajectory in FY26, supported
by continued positive momentum in
the Indian economy despite global
headwinds. However, commodity
inflation may add cost pressures due
to safeguarding duties and rising
global demand.
The Indian passenger vehicle
market is expected to sustain in the
year with overall demand growth
being shaped by macroeconomic
factors such as consumption growth,
inflation, infrastructure spending and
global geopolitics.

Executive Director’s message
Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles is
driving forward sustainable, digitally
enabled mobility solutions and
deepening customer engagement
through future-ready products and
services that deliver greater efficiency,
reliability, and long-term value.

Girish Wagh

Executive Director,
Tata Motors Limited

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this letter finds you and your
families in good health.
FY25 was a year of mixed trends for the
Indian Commercial Vehicle industry,
shaped by macroeconomic caution and
evolving market dynamics. The industry
recorded a marginal decline of ~1%,
primarily due to pressures in the HCV
and SCV segments, especially in Q2.
While cautious sentiment ahead of
state and general elections led to a
moderation in demand, segments like
buses remained resilient — driven by
public transport investments and the
shift to electric mobility. Encouragingly,
electric CVs gained traction,
especially in buses and last-mile
applications, supported by improving
TCO economics. Across the board,
infrastructure investments, cleaner fuel
adoption, and digitalisation continued
to shape fleet and OEM strategies.

Sustaining momentum,
driving impact

In a year of varying demand, Tata
Motors Commercial Vehicles
built further on the foundation

of financial fitness laid in FY24 to
deliver an improved performance
with disciplined cost management,
improved realisation, and the growing
contribution of our Parts, Service
and other Downstream businesses.
Despite marginal declines in sales
volumes, our EBIT reached an all-time
high of I6,794 crore — representing
a 4.9% growth over FY24. The business
outperformed the industry, gaining
share and improving realisation in
Trucks and Buses.

channel partners, mechanics,
financiers, fleet owners, logistics
providers, and — importantly —
drivers. By leveraging our extensive
physical network and digital platforms
such as Fleet Edge, we deliver
integrated, tech-enabled solutions to
all ecosystem players.

With the restructuring into eight
focused business verticals now fully
embedded, our transformation into
a future-ready, customer-centric
organisation is enhancing our agility,
strengthening accountability, and
aligning us more closely with both our
strategic priorities and the evolving
needs of our customers.

The adoption of smart telematics
across ~8,00,000 vehicles is
enabling data-driven decisions that
improve uptime, reduce operating
costs, and enhance driver safety.
Our Customer Success Centres (CSCs)
are helping fleet operators maximise
performance and minimise downtime.
Our comprehensive engagement also
extends to mechanics and Logistic
Service Providers through initiatives
like Fleet Edge and Fleet Verse,
ensuring a cohesive and future-ready
CV ecosystem.

Building an end-to-end
ecosystem

Rebranding to reflect
our purpose

A core part of our long-term strategy is
building a vibrant, digitally connected
ecosystem that includes suppliers,

With the forthcoming demerger
being a key inflection point, we are
repositioning ourselves through

22

the ‘Better Always’ brand refresh.
In response to the ever-changing
customer expectations on agility,
technology and partnership for
greater success, we are refocusing
all our actions to sharpen our Core
Value Proposition. This new identity
captures our core ethos — agility and
growth-oriented mindset, pushing
the limits with positivity and humility
and an endeavour to deliver better
in every moment to all stakeholders.
It will be a cornerstone in building
brand distinctiveness and customer
resonance in the post-demerger phase.

Accelerating innovation
and sustainability

Innovation remains central to our
purpose. This year, we proudly unveiled
India’s first Hydrogen-powered Internal
Combustion Engine (H2ICE) truck — a
significant milestone in our alternate
fuel roadmap. We continue to invest in
clean mobility across EVs, CNG, LNG,
and hydrogen, ensuring our customers
have access to a range of sustainable
choices. We have invested ahead of
time in various EV hardware aggregates
as well as control software, which
will enhance the performance and
efficiency of our Electric vehicles being
launched across the range during this
year. Similarly, we are keenly exploring
the opportunities in Software Defined
Vehicles, including the enabling vehicle
architecture and technology stack,
with an aim to address India-specific
market and customer requirements.
Our Smart City Mobility portfolio has
now deployed over 3,600 electric
buses, covering 30+ crore km with
>95% uptime. With Renewable
Electricity (RE) now powering over
45% of our CV Operations and Scope 3
emissions down 12% year-on-year, we
are well on track toward our Net Zero
and RE100 goals.

Embracing the digital and
AI opportunity

The digital foundations laid over the
past years are now enabling us to
adopt AI-led transformations — both in
customer-facing solutions and internal
operations. We are piloting AI-driven
predictive maintenance, real-time fleet
insights, intelligent CRM tools, and
personalisation in sales journeys. These
steps will help us offer differentiated
value, sharpen our responsiveness,
and elevate user experience.
We have also made good progress on
Enterprise Digital, especially in the
area of Industry 4.0 in manufacturing,
digitalisation of the supply chain,
and E-Guru in sales. This has led
to significant improvement in our
delivery performance as well as
overall efficiency.

Building a global business

Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles
is an enterprise with strong global
aspirations. Our products are already
present in several markets, and we
continue to build capabilities and forge
alliances to strengthen the same —
while staying attuned to geopolitical
and tariff-related challenges that may
shape the near-term trade landscape.

Empowering drivers,
enhancing road safety

At the heart of our business lies the
community of drivers, the unmarked
soldiers who keep the wheels of
our growing economy running. We
continue to expand our outreach and
support for drivers through training
programmes, wellness initiatives, and
digital tools that enhance safety and
efficiency. Notable efforts include
the deployment of ADAS (Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems) features
in key models and safety training
modules integrated within our driver
connect platforms. Our commitment

to road safety is reflected in sustained
partnerships with regulatory bodies
and transport associations to drive
behaviour change and awareness.

Developing talent,

TMCV’s growth is underpinned by
a culture of continuous learning
and capability building. We have
scaled multiple talent development
programmes focused on future
skills, leadership, diversity, and
digital proficiency. Our investments
in technical training centres and
partnerships with academic institutions
ensure that we are readying a future-fit
workforce aligned with industry shifts.

Looking ahead

The commercial vehicle industry is fast
transforming toward cleaner, smarter,
and more connected solutions, and
Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles is
well positioned to lead this evolution.
While FY26 brings optimism with
anticipated post-election policy clarity
and infrastructure momentum, the
global economic landscape remains
fluid. Geopolitical uncertainties and
emerging trade barriers may impact
global commerce and, in turn, our
international aspirations. We remain
vigilant and responsive to these
dynamics, guided by a sharper, more
agile organisation, a deeply integrated
ecosystem, strong global ambitions,
and an unwavering commitment to
innovation. This foundation gives us
the confidence to navigate near-term
challenges while unlocking sustainable,
long-term growth and value for
all stakeholders.
Thank you for your continued trust

External
environment
FY25 was another eventful year wherein overall CV industry volumes were marginally lower than FY24.
Despite challenges through the year, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles achieved industry-leading growth
in trucks and commercial passenger carriers, thereby strengthening its market share as well as improving
the realisation. With continued growth in downstream and international business, the Company was
able to deliver healthy financials in FY25. Actions on Sustainability transition are progressing as per
plan; reinforcing our commitment to green, future-ready technologies, the Company has developed and
introduced India’s first hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck for real-world testing, while our e-bus fleet
continues to grow across Indian cities, collectively covering over 30 crore km cumulatively.

The industry witnessed a dynamic
FY25, marked by distinct quarterly
shifts. Q1 began on a positive note,
with growth led by the M&HCV
segment. Q2 saw a moderation in
demand due to monsoon disruptions,
reduced fleet utilisation, and slower
execution of infrastructure projects.
In Q3, the industry saw sequential
recovery, aided by the resumption
of construction and mining activity
and festive season demand. The
momentum continued into Q4,
indicating improving macroeconomic
stability. Despite early challenges, the
industry closed the year with signs of
recovery for the coming year.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Commodity price movements
and strategic implications

In FY25, steel prices in India saw a
significant decline, driven by global
oversupply, subdued demand,
cheaper imports from China, lower
input costs, and increased domestic
production capacity. This downward
trend, especially in the latter half of
the year, offered some relief to OEM
margins. However, the overall volatility
— shaped by global supply-demand
imbalances and geopolitical tensions
— continued to impact vehicle pricing,
procurement strategies, and cost
structures. As a result, raw material
management remained a critical focus
area for manufacturers across the
commercial vehicle value chain.

Shift from mini trucks
to pickups

In FY25, customer preferences began
shifting from mini trucks to pickups,
particularly in rural and semi-urban
markets. This trend was influenced
by rising costs in the mini truck
segment post-BS6 implementation,
including higher EMIs and stagnant
freight rates. Pick-ups gained traction
due to their higher payload capacity,
improved drivability, and aspirational
appeal. While mini trucks continue
to serve important use cases, OEMs
are expanding their pick-up offerings
to address evolving needs in last-mile
delivery and small business operations.

24

Changing customer
requirement – Movement
to higher tonnage

Fleet operators increasingly opted
for higher tonnage trucks to improve
operational efficiency and reduce
cost per tonne-kilometre. This
shift was driven by rising freight
volumes, logistics consolidation, and
the expansion of hub-and-spoke
distribution models. OEMs responded
by fortifying their heavy-duty portfolio,
focusing on fuel efficiency, durability,
and total cost of ownership to meet the
evolving needs of large fleet operators.

Rising demand for
alternate fuel buses

FY25 saw a surge in demand for
alternate fuel buses, particularly
electric, CNG, and LNG variants.
Urban transport bodies and state
undertakings prioritised cleaner
mobility solutions, supported
by government subsidies and
environmental mandates. This shift

25

INTEGRATED
REPORT

accelerated the transition toward
sustainable public transportation,
prompting OEMs to invest in alternate
fuel technologies and expand their
green mobility offerings across city and
intercity segments.

Government push for
electrification in commercial
vehicles

While infrastructure spending was
relatively limited in FY25 due to fiscal
constraints and election-related
priorities, the government intensified
its focus on electrification in the
commercial vehicle sector. Incentives
under the PM e-Drive scheme and
various state EV policies supported
the adoption of electric buses,
three-wheelers, and light commercial
vehicles. This shift aligned with national
sustainability goals and emission
reduction targets, encouraging OEMs
to accelerate investments in electric
mobility solutions and expand their
zero-emission product portfolios.

and value-added services that
enhance customer productivity
and operational efficiency. During
the year, we made significant
strides in product and technology
leadership. We became the first Indian

Managing Director’s message
This year has also seen several
exciting product launches across
EV and ICE segments, reinforcing
our deep understanding of evolving
customer aspirations and our ability
to deliver differentiated mobility
experiences at scale.
Shailesh Chandra

Managing Director,
Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited &
Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this letter finds you in good
health and spirits.
FY25 proved to be a year of resilience
for the Indian passenger vehicle (PV)
industry. After three consecutive years
of strong growth, the sector entered
a phase of consolidation, growing by a
modest 2% with 4.3 million units sold.
While demand for personal mobility
remained steady, macroeconomic
headwinds and a high base effect
contributed to a moderation in overall
industry growth.
This moderate growth was fuelled
by the continued rising popularity of
SUVs — which accounted for 55% of
total sales and a rapidly increasing
consumer preference toward
environmentally friendly powertrains.
Preference for emission-friendly
CNG vehicles surged by ~35%, and
Electric vehicles gained renewed
momentum, supported by a growing
number of industry players expanding
customer choices and reinforcing the
EV ecosystem.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

At Tata Motors, we navigated this
evolving landscape with agility and
determination while making steady
progress on key strategic priorities,
strengthening the foundation for
sustainable, long-term growth. Despite
lower discretionary spending among
consumers, our vehicles continued to
attract strong interest, underpinned by
a reputation for safety, innovation, and
design. Our customer-first approach
enabled us to maintain leadership or
strong positions across key segments.
In FY25, the Tata Motors PV and EV
businesses registered wholesales of
5,56,367 units, including 64,269 units
of EVs with a revenue of I48,445 crore
and an EBIT of 0.9%. Amidst a
challenging environment, the business
remained resilient, recording an
EBITDA % improvement of 40 bps
over FY24, enabled by holistic
cost‑reduction initiatives and tight
control over fixed costs.
In the EV segment, we became one
of the few global manufacturers

to achieve positive EBITDA, on the
back of a higher level of localisation,
aggressive cost reduction, and securing
PLI benefits.

Driving market agility with
innovation

In a year marked by fluctuating
demand, our ‘demand pull strategy’
strongly focused on market
responsiveness for deeper engagement
with customers and channel partners.
We actively used Vahan registration
data as a near real-time indicator of
retail performance to track regional
trends to fine-tune both our supply and
product mix as well as its availability.
We outpaced the overall SUV market
with strategic launches and targeted
product enhancements that resonated
strongly with our customers. Across
various segments of the industry,
Tata Punch emerged as the top choice
for private buyers and also ranked
as India’s No. 1 SUV in FY25. During
the year, we successfully launched
India’s first SUV Coupe under the new

32

nameplate ‘Curvv’ and introduced the
country’s first turbocharged CNG in
‘Nexon iCNG’. These products played
a pivotal role in our growth in this
fast‑expanding segment.
Our multi-powertrain strategy and
strong commitment to sustainable
mobility enabled us to increase the
share of CNG and electric vehicles to
36% of our overall portfolio. In specific,
in the CNG segment, we outgrew the
industry at 53% growth compared to
FY24, with over 130 thousand CNG
vehicles sold.

Elevating customer affinity

Accelerating EV adoption

To build preference for EVs and upscale
the available charging infrastructure,
we announced the next phase of
Open Collaboration, introducing a
comprehensive suite of services to
build greater customer confidence
and deliver seamless access to the
broader EV ecosystem. In line with
this commitment, we are rolling out
hundreds of Tata.ev mega chargers
across the country, in collaboration
with partners. We also inaugurated
new Tata.ev stores in Kerala, furthering
our mission to make electric mobility
more accessible and sustainable.

We made customer service our
foremost priority, with dedicated
efforts and focused initiatives
to elevate every aspect of the
ownership experience. In line with
this commitment, we significantly
expanded our service network by
adding over 1,300 workshop bays and
modernising facilities with advanced
AI-powered diagnostics and analytics
— enabling faster, more precise service
delivery driving higher levels of trust,
convenience, and customer delight.
We also continued to strengthen
our presence across the country
through targeted marketing efforts
and the strategic expansion of our
retail footprint, adding 102 new sales
outlets to make customer engagement
even more seamless. The launch
of an all-new mobile application
further enriched the end-to-end
customer journey, offering enhanced
convenience and connectivity.

Surpassing milestones

At the Bharat Mobility Global
Expo, we proudly showcased our
future‑ready mobility portfolio —
spanning sustainable, connected, and
intelligent solutions. This reaffirmed
our leadership in redefining mobility in
India and our commitment to deliver
experiences that resonate deeply with
evolving customer aspirations.

In line with our ambition to achieve
Net Zero emissions by 2040, we
made significant strides in reducing
Scope 1 and 2 emissions while
maintaining industry leadership in
CAFE compliance, well above target
emissions. Over 47% of the electricity
consumed at our PV and EV plants
is sourced from renewable sources,

33

INTEGRATED
REPORT

This year, we achieved two significant
milestones portraying the remarkable
progress of both our PV and EV
businesses over the years. The PV
business crossed 6 million cumulative
sales, while the EV business surpassed
2,00,000 cumulative sales. Our EVs
have collectively covered over 5 billion
kilometres, saving more than 7,00,000
metric tonnes of CO₂ emissions —
equivalent to the environmental
impact of planting 30 million trees.
We ramped up production at our new
facility in Sanand, and conducted
groundbreaking for our new facility in
Tamil Nadu, setting the stage for future
growth. As we scale, we continue to
embrace higher levels of automation
and AI to drive efficiency, agility and
progress toward a smarter, more
future-ready manufacturing footprint.

and we have developed a clear
roadmap towards water neutrality
and zero waste to landfill, reinforcing
our commitment to minimising our
ecological footprint. In parallel, we
advanced our circularity initiatives
through closed-loop systems for key
materials and launched focused actions
to preserve biodiversity across our
operations and in India.

Looking ahead

While FY25 presented challenges
for the industry, the fundamental
drivers for safe, smart, and
sustainable mobility remain strong.
The forthcoming demerger will
be a significant milestone in our
journey, unlocking enhanced focus,
agility, and value creation across our
businesses. This strategic move will
empower each entity to pursue its own
growth trajectory, driven by greater
customer orientation and innovation.
Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles is
well‑positioned to capitalise on this
shift, with a robust pipeline of exciting
product launches across both EV and
ICE segments. Our future‑focused
portfolio, backed by a deep
understanding of evolving customer
needs, ensures we remain poised
to deliver differentiated mobility
experiences at scale.
I remain confident in our ability to
emerge stronger and deliver long‑term
value to all stakeholders. This confidence
is driven by the dedication, passion,
and talent of our people, whose
commitment is at the heart of our
success. I thank you for your continued
trust, support, and belief in our journey.
Warm Regards,

Shailesh Chandra

Moderation in growth rates

After three years of robust post-Covid
expansion, FY25 marked a phase
of growth moderation for the PV
industry, aligned with broader trends
in domestic consumption. The industry
registered wholesales of 4.3 million
units, reflecting a modest 2% growth
over FY24. While OEMs maintained
a strong wholesale push, customer
demand remained subdued, leading
to a highly competitive, discountdriven environment.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Sustained segmental shift
towards SUVs

In FY25, SUVs continued to be the
growth engine for the industry, with
double-digit growth for the segment,
pushing the salience to an all-time high
of 55%. In contrast, hatchback and
sedan segments saw a steep decline
of 12-13% over the previous year. This
segmental shift has been driven by
evolving customer preference towards
larger, feature-rich and practical
SUVs, coupled with a strong pipeline
of new launches concentrated in the
SUV segment.

Strong growth in CNG segment
The industry also saw strong
momentum in fuel-type transitions,
with CNG vehicles registering ~35%
growth versus FY24. This has been
driven by rising personal segment
traction for CNGs due to expanding
CNG infrastructure, rising customer
awareness and the introduction
of models offering features and
performance on par with other ICE
counterparts. This surge has elevated
CNG to the second-largest fuel
category, accounting for more than
18% of new PV sales.

Strategic and
performance review

Outpacing industry in
high‑growth segments

In FY25, we outpaced the industry in
high-growth segments, delivering an
11% growth in the SUV segment. This
has been driven by the strong demand
for the Tata Punch, which became the
highest-selling model in the industry in
CY24, along with the sustained demand
for the Tata Nexon. The launch of
India’s first SUV Coupe, the Tata Curvv,
further contributed to this momentum,
receiving widespread appreciation
from both the media and customers.
Additionally, in the CNG segment,
we recorded a remarkable 53% y-o-y
growth, bolstered by a robust twincylinder portfolio and the successful
launch of Nexon iCNG, aligned with
evolving customer preferences.

Strengthening

A key focus this year has been on
strengthening customer experience
across touchpoints through
comprehensive initiatives. These
include ramping up service capacity
with 1,300+ new bays across India,
modernising over 450 workshops,
leveraging AI and analytics for more
efficient vehicle diagnostics, enhanced
technician training and optimisation
of service logistics. We have also
revamped our roadside assistance
programme, including live tracking and
increased on-site repairs to improve
responsiveness and effectiveness.
These combined actions have led to
an enhanced after-sales experience,
leading to a significant increase in
positive mentions by customers.

Renewed Momentum for EV
industry in H2 FY25

While the first half of FY25 saw
subdued EV demand due to negative
global sentiment and the expiry of
certain incentives, the second half
of the year marked a strong revival.
New product launches by major OEMs
and a growing charging network
have renewed consumer interest and
confidence in EVs. These collective
efforts have reinvigorated the EV
ecosystem, setting the stage for
sustained growth and reaffirming the
long-term potential of electric mobility
in India.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Slowdown in fleet segment,
followed by recovery

The EV fleet segment experienced
a sharp 30% decline in registrations
in FY25, following the expiry of the
FAME II incentive, which affected
demand for fleets. There had also
been a pre-buying surge in March
2024, which triggered a subsequent
slowdown in purchases in the
following months. This temporary
dip impacted overall fleet demand
during the initial quarters. However,
signs of recovery have emerged in Q4
FY25, supported by improved market
sentiment and growth in the employee
transportation segment.

Expanding charging
ecosystem

India’s EV charging infrastructure is
growing rapidly, with over 21,000
public chargers now installed across
the country. A key highlight has been
the widening of charging coverage
along national highways, significantly
enhancing customer confidence in
long-distance and intercity travel.
This progress is being driven by
government support and open
collaboration by Tata Motors.

Strategic and
performance review

Ensuring India’s widest and
most proven EV portfolio

Our core strength is having India’s
widest and most accessible EV
portfolio, spanning multiple body
styles and price points — from I8 lakh
to I22 lakh. Our tried-and-tested EVs
have collectively clocked over 5 billion
kilometres on Indian roads, and are
catering to a broad range of customer
needs and use cases. With the addition
of the Curvv.ev this year and futureready models like the Sierra, Harrier,
and AVINYA announced, our EVs
continue to set benchmarks in safety,
technology, features, and design.
In addition, our extensive EV network
has enabled us to attract a diverse
range of customers across multiple
geographies and has been a core pillar
of our EV leadership.

Building a robust EV
Charging Ecosystem through
collaboration

We are actively shaping a strong and
accessible EV ecosystem through open
collaboration with key stakeholders,
driving rapid charging infrastructure
growth across key hotspots
nationwide. This year, to enhance the
customer experience, we introduced
a unified charging aggregator app
that simplifies access to public
charging, and mitigates the need to
have multiple apps. In the next phase
of Open Collaboration for Charging,
we announced a comprehensive
suite of services for EV customers
to enhance ownership experience
including Tata.ev Verified chargers and
announced our commitment to deploy
500 Tata.ev Mega chargers to support
the segment’s next wave of growth.

Leveraging localisation
as a differentiator

Localisation remains a key
differentiator in our strategy, with
75–80% localisation at Tier 1 level.
This high degree of localisation
provides significant agility, cost
advantages, and enhanced supply
chain resilience. Beyond operational
benefits, it also contributes
meaningfully to the long-term growth
of India’s EV ecosystem. Our strong
localisation efforts have further
enabled us to qualify for and secure
benefits under the Government of
India’s Production Linked Incentive
(PLI) scheme, which we will use to
fund our future investments into
sustainable mobility.

Tata.ev Verified Chargers offer
customers enhanced peace of mind
during highway travel by ensuring
reliability and accessibility, while
the ongoing rollout of Tata.ev Mega
chargers strengthens long-distance EV
ecosystem with faster, high-capacity
charging solutions.

CEO message
The robustness of JLR’s Reimagine strategy
was affirmed in FY25 as the company set
new records, delivered profit before tax of
£2.5 billion, versus £2.2 billion year-on-year,
and in April this year, we were proud of our
achievement becoming net cash positive.

Adrian Mardell

Chief Executive Officer,
Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC

Dear Shareholders,
This FY25, was the ﬁrst test of JLR’s
reestablished ﬁnancial stability. In
FY24, the company broke a series of
its ﬁnancial records following a period
characterised by the global pandemic,
semiconductor shortages, inﬂation,
the energy crisis, and geopolitical
instability.
Against this backdrop, the robustness
of JLR’s Reimagine strategy was
affirmed in FY25 as the company set
new records, delivered proﬁt before
tax of £2.5 billion, versus £2.2 billion
year‑on-year, and we were proud
to conﬁrm the achievement of our
strategic goals of 8.5% adjusted EBIT
margin and becoming net cash positive.
Achieving a net cash positive position
is a huge milestone for JLR; an
ambition ﬁrst stated at the launch of
our Reimagine strategy in February
2021. Having eliminated successfully
£5.0 billion of debt since the peak in
August 2022, the company is now net
debt free thanks to focused, prudent,
and strong ﬁnancial discipline.  
The business encountered headwinds
this year including a downturn in the
Chinese economy, which impacted
our China volumes, and an aluminium
supply shortage in the second quarter.
The latter delayed deliveries of cars
to clients and impacted quarterly

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

wholesales, but we recovered strongly
in the second half of the ﬁnancial year.
The transition to electric vehicles also
moved more slowly than expected,
which will impact automotive
manufacturers facing tighter emissions
regulations. That we reached our net
debt zero goal is testament to the
quality and resilience of our business
and the skill of our people.  
In FY25, we also broke records,
achieving the highest ever quarter
one and quarter three revenues in
JLR’s history, while we also delivered
our highest quarter four and full
year EBIT margin in a decade. These
highlights illustrate that, despite market
challenges, our vehicles continue to
be highly desirable to clients around
the world.
FY25 was also a year of signiﬁcant
operational progress for our
Reimagine strategy.
As part of our £18 billion investment
over ﬁve years from, 2024 to 2028,
we invested £500 million to transform
our Halewood facility for the electric
era, with considerable progress in
the construction of new facilities
for pure‑electric vehicle production
already completed.
That news was followed by the
announcement that Range Rover’s

historic home, JLR’s Solihull plant,
is now ready to build pure-electric
Range Rover models alongside internal
combustion and plug-in electric hybrid
siblings. This highlights the incredible
versatility of our Modular Longitudinal
Architecture (MLA) on which Range
Rover and Range Rover Sport are built,
enabling us to offer powertrains that
match the demands of markets around
the world.
While our preparations to build electric
vehicles reached an advanced stage,
we also announced the expansion of
our bespoke paint facilities in Nitra,
Slovakia and Castle Bromwich, UK,
to meet increasing client demand for
personalisation across our brands. We
have seen demand for our personalised
paint options on Range Rover models
double in the last three years, as
clients look to add their own touch
to their luxury vehicles. To support
our sustainability strategy, at Castle
Bromwich we are installing the latest
energy efficient paint technology and
ﬁltration techniques to cut power and
water use. We will also utilise fully
automated spray robots which reduce
paint waste versus hand painting
methods. The new fully electric paint
booth and electric curing ovens at
Nitra meanwhile will help to reduce
carbon emissions.

46

In addition, we made a signiﬁcant
technical breakthrough in the
closed‑loop recycling of polyurethane
seat foam from our used vehicles
by successfully reintegrating it back
into the production of new seats,
a ﬁrst for the automotive industry.
We also joined forces with global
tyre manufacturer Pirelli, to use tyres
made with sustainably sourced natural
rubber across our brands. The tyres
are certiﬁed by the Forest Stewardship
Council (FSC), and JLR will be the ﬁrst
to adopt FSC®-certiﬁed rubber tyres at
scale, debuting on the new Range Rover
Electric. The commitment will amount
to over 2,50,000 FSC®-certiﬁed tyres
per year.
All these steps help ladder up to our
aim of being carbon net zero by 2039.
Meanwhile, our luxury brands Range
Rover, Defender, Discovery, and Jaguar
all had noteworthy years.
We further expanded our Range Rover
model lineup with the launch of the
new Range Rover Sport SV Edition Two,
a collection of ﬁve Range Rover Sport
SV Celestial models, alongside marketspeciﬁc Range Rover Bespoke editions
such as the Ranthambore in India and
the Candeo in the United States of
America. Development of the Range
Rover Electric continued at pace with
the vehicle being tested on the frozen
lakes of Sweden and the deserts of the
United Arab Emirates.
And we launched the superlative
Defender OCTA, the most powerful and
dynamic Defender ever, to widespread
acclaim from the world’s media when
they test drove it in South Africa.
It was a moment of huge personal
pride and excitement to unveil the
beautiful Jaguar Type 00 design vision
concept to an audience at Miami Art
Week, in December. The breathtaking
vision concept car drew the attention
of almost a billion people around the
world and was a bold step towards
Jaguar’s new future, returning it to the
luxury sector where it has thrived in the
past. I have a deep personal connection
with Jaguar where I began my career,
and I cannot wait to reveal more about
the ﬁrst car, an all-electric four-door
GT with around 1,000 horsepower.
Our Jaguar TCS Racing Formula E team
also returned the brand to success on
the racetrack, winning the 2024 ABB FIA
Formula E Teams’ World Championship,
its ﬁrst racing title since 1991 and

47

REPORT

a proud and historic moment for
the company.
And this year, we celebrated 35 years of
the Discovery. The original team behind
Discovery were convinced that there
was a gap in the market for a new kind
of car for curious, active families who
wanted to travel far and wide together.
Our cultural transformation continued
this year as we celebrated events
including Black History Month, Diwali,
and Pride. We published our Diversity,
Equity and Inclusion Review which
noted that JLR has made great strides in
making its workplace more inclusive for
everyone, through training, coaching
and new policies to support colleagues
with different challenges, such as
offering those experiencing symptoms
of menopause the right to seek support
at any time and from day one of their
employment.
At JLR, we remain committed to
building a workplace where every
colleague feels respected and valued.
Why? Because it reﬂects the society
we live in and the clients we serve,
it delivers better business outcomes.
We believe a workplace that is diverse,
equitable and inclusive is right for
JLR, as well as it being the right thing
to do. We know our policies are the
right ones for JLR because our eNPS
(employee Net Promotor Score) - 
a direct reﬂection of job satisfaction
- has risen signiﬁcantly since we began
our transformation. More motivated,
engaged colleagues deliver better
results for our clients.
This year, it was with great pleasure
that we strengthened the JLRL Board
with the appointments of Steve
Marsh and Russell Leslie as Executive
Director Vehicle Programmes
and Executive Director Enterprise
Quality and Customer Satisfaction
respectively.  We also welcomed three
new executives to the JLRL First Line
of Leadership with the appointments
of Swarna Ramanathan as Chief
Strategy Officer; Andrea Debbane as
Chief Sustainability Officer and John
Beswick as Chief Transformation
& Performance Officer.

& Sustainability, who returned to his
home in Brazil to take up a new position
at TCS Latam as Senior Advisor – New
Business & Sustainability Director,
based in São Paulo. I would like to thank
both Barbara and François sincerely for
their incredible contributions to JLR.
Finally, with profound sadness,
in early October we learned of
the passing of Mr. Ratan Tata. His
personal achievements and legacy
are unequalled in society, and the
mark he leaves on our business and
brands is greater than that of any
other individual.
It was thanks to Mr. Tata’s singular
vision that Tata acquired JLR in 2008,
and we owe everything we have
become since then to his unwavering
support and dedication. He led us on
an extraordinary journey, inspiring
incredible new chapters in our history.
Under his generous and trusting
guidance, we have felt deeply proud to
be part of the Tata story.
Perpetuating the philanthropic story
of the Tata family, JLR this year created
the JLR Foundation, a charitable
foundation dedicated to empowering
children and young people to reach
their full potential and catalyse positive
social and environmental change.
JLR is committed to donating millions
to the JLR Foundation, pledging up to
£2.5 million to support its charitable
work in the ﬁrst year, with plans to
increase funding annually as the
Foundation grows.
This year has tested JLR, and we
have risen to the challenges. Despite
headwinds, we have again set new
records and demonstrated our
company’s underlying strength. This
strong and consistent performance, the
commitment of our people, partners
and clients and the appeal of our luxury
brands will support our response to
current global economic challenges and
the evolving global trade environment.
Warm Regards,

Adrian Mardell

We also said goodbye to two members
of my team this year: Executive Director
of Industrial Operations Barbara
Bergmeier, as she took the decision
to return to her native Germany after
two incredible years transforming JLR’s
industrial operations and; François

Reimagine
Reimagine is our strategy
for transforming JLR into an
exceptional, progressive and
more sustainable business.

With sustainability at the heart of everything we do, we aim to achieve our goal of
being carbon net zero by 2039 by providing our clients with a pure-electric variant
of all JLR brands by the end of the decade.
Through Reimagine, we have delivered the highest full year profit in a decade and
have achieved our target of becoming net cash positive by FY25.’
As part of our strategy, we have created a house of four truly exceptional brands:
Range Rover, Defender, Discovery, and Jaguar, each with its own DNA, unique
interpretation and strategy to become a distinct, desirable and proﬁtable brand.
Under this structure, we elevate the unique characteristics and status of each
individual British marque, creating an emotional connection with our clients, from
leading by example with Range Rover to embracing the impossible with Defender
and enjoying family adventures with Discovery.
This past year we launched the fearlessly creative Jaguar brand, truly a copy
of nothing.
We also opened the waiting list for our ﬁrst pure-electric car conceived under
the Reimagine strategy, Range Rover Electric, which now stands which now
exceeds 59,000.
The electric future of all our brands is fundamental in our journey to carbon net
zero, but it must be delivered at the pace at which different markets electrify
around the world. To do this, we have a ﬂexible powertrain strategy enabling us to
offer internal combustion, plug-in hybrid and full electric powertrains according to
the demands of individual markets. Our Modular Longitudinal Architecture (MLA),
on which Range Rover and Range Rover Sport are based, offers all three options
to clients.
Following on from the reveal of the Jaguar Type 00 design vision vehicle in
December 2024, we will reveal the ﬁrst production all-electric Jaguar on the
dedicated Jaguar Electriﬁed Architecture (JEA) later this year, taking a step towards
all of our brands offering pure-electric options by 2030.

Industrial transformation

Reimagine is also about transforming our facilities to deliver this electriﬁed
future. We have completed the ﬁrst test builds of Range Rover Electric in Solihull,
following a considerable investment to upgrade and digitise our production lines
ahead of client builds commencing. At Halewood, Merseyside, we are investing
£500 million to enable the parallel production of existing internal combustion and
plug-in electric hybrid vehicles with next generation pure electric models built on
the Electriﬁed Modular Architecture (EMA). Our Electric Propulsion Manufacturing
Centre in Wolverhampton, is now ready to produce battery packs and electric
drive units.
Beyond our products, Reimagine is committed to driving environmental,
human and community impact for a truly exceptional business. To do this, our
sustainability strategy is divided into three areas: Planet Regenerate, Engage for
Good and Responsible Business.

Planet Regenerate is focused on
environmental impacts and includes
our climate commitments, circular
economy strategy and emerging plans
on nature and biodiversity. We aim
to achieve net zero carbon emissions
across our supply chain, products, and
operations by 2039, with all brands
offering pure-electric options by 2030.
Engage for Good draws upon Tata
Group’s 150-year tradition of social
responsibility and community
support. Our goal is to set a standard
for creating meaningful human and
community impact, prioritising care
for the environments and communities
where we operate with a focus on
supporting the most vulnerable
and disadvantaged.
Our Responsible Business pillar
includes our activity to address
Environmental, Social & Governance
(ESG) legislation, including developing
the right commitments, transparently
reporting progress and having effective
risk management in place.

Partnerships accelerating
Reimagine

A key element of Reimagine is about
partnerships with leaders in their ﬁeld.
In a groundbreaking move in China,
JLR is reviving the beloved Freelander
brand through a licensing agreement
with Chery Jaguar Land Rover (CJLR).
CJLR will launch a range of electric
vehicles under the Freelander
name, initially in China, the world’s
largest EV market, with potential for
global expansion.
Building on our successes in
motorsport, we announced our ﬁrst
foray into Dakar, with Defender
OCTA providing the platform for an
extremely robust and durable rally
speciﬁcation Defender, which will
compete as part of a three-year FIA
World Rally-Raid Championship (W2RC)
campaign beginning in 2026.

Innovation and ventures

Through our Open Innovation and

Challenges

External challenges have
had varying levels of impact
on our business throughout
FY25. We have responded
to these challenges and
improved our performance
y-o-y. Our commitment to our
Reimagine strategy continues
as we transition to becoming
proud creators of the world’s
most desirable luxury brands
for the most discerning clients. Supply constraints

The automotive industry is often
impacted by supply constraints,
and whilst the easing of the supply
constraints from prior years continued,
our production volumes in the second
quarter of the year were impacted by
a temporary supply disruption.
During the summer of 2024 a Tier
1 supplier of high-grade aluminium
to the automotive sector suffered
ﬂooding at its plant in Switzerland.
As a result, there was a short-term
impact on our production and
consequently operating volumes in Q2;
however, we recovered strongly in H2,
with minimal impact on our production
schedules and clients’ orders.

Rising costs

In recent years, our marketing costs
have been lower than historical
levels due to the business being
supply-constrained. Our rich mix of
Range Rover, Range Rover Sport,
and Defender has enjoyed strong
demand throughout the year with
minimal levels of variable marketing
expense, although we are now seeing
an increase in these costs across our
product portfolio. We will continue
to maintain a demand-led model,
but ﬁxed marketing investment
and variable marketing expenses
are expected to continue to rise in
response to tougher market conditions.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

China market conditions

The China market continued to face
headwinds throughout the year, as
our locally produced cars operate in
a highly competitive environment,
and retailer insolvencies and credit
availability impacted volumes.
We continue to offer retailer support
and focus on marketing and sales
efforts through model mix optimisation
to improve retailer proﬁtability. At the
start of the year we announced the
news that the Freelander brand will
create complementary growth in China
through a licensing agreement with our
joint venture partner, Chery.

Geopolitical

Geopolitical challenges, including
increasing geopolitical tensions and
regulatory and legislative changes,
have global reach and can impact
supply chains. While we have not
observed any direct impacts on our
business in the last year as a result of
speciﬁc events, we proactively scenario
plan against a range of outcomes
to ensure we’re able to effectively
respond as a business. In addition, we
are closely monitoring trade measures
of the new administration in the US

Transition to electriﬁcation

Jaguar has been reimagined as an

by its Type 00 design vision concept,
which debuted at Miami Art Week in
December 2024. The ﬁrst reimagined
production car will be the most
powerful Jaguar ever, with a range of
c. 700 kilometres.
The Range Rover Electric has
undergone rigorous testing in the
year and nears its testing completion
programme prior to its launch later this
year. The vehicle’s capabilities surpass
any other luxury electric SUV, and over
59,867 clients signed up to the waiting
list as at 31 March 2025.
JLR and Chery are forging an innovative
collaboration model that epitomises
our growth path for the future through
the licensing of Freelander. The blend
of Chery’s advanced EV technology
with the distinctive appeal of the
Freelander brand will provide China

Our shift to electriﬁcation is central
to transforming our business and to

Execution of Reimagine

During the year, we announced a £500
million investment to transform our
historic Halewood facility to support
the parallel production of electric
vehicles, alongside existing combustion
and hybrid models, before eventually
becoming our ﬁrst all-electric

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the
past two to three years have revolutionised the technology
landscape. Generative AI is emerging as a transformative
force and is fundamentally different from the previous waves
of technology disruption.
AI will have a transformative impact on every business, both
B2C and B2B, in more ways than one. There is tremendous
opportunity across our group companies to enhance
customer experiences, reimagine manufacturing processes,
innovate product design and engineering, and improve
employee engagement with an AI-driven approach.

Recognising the critical role of data
in scaling AI initiatives, we are driving
data maturity across Group Companies
through a comprehensive data excellence
framework. Companies are setting up
Centres of Excellence (CoEs) to identify and
implement impactful AI projects and build
tech talent.
Our investments in Cloud, Data and Digital provide a strong
foundation for our AI journey. At Tata Group, we continue
to strengthen partnerships with leading technology firms
and research institutes to access the latest AI developments.
Given the rapid pace of change in AI technologies, we
continue to upskill our workforce and build vibrant
communities for learning and sharing.
With the evolving threat landscape, cybersecurity remains
a top priority. Tata Group companies are making significant
investments in advanced cybersecurity technologies and
workforce training to safeguard against evolving cyber risks.

Technology and innovation
Driving a customer-first transformation while modernising Enterprise Digital
Capabilities were the focal points of the year gone by. Technology and innovation
will power a future-ready enterprise that is efficient, intelligent, and deeply
customer-centric.
Customer experience:
personalised, predictive, and
connected
Customer-centricity remains at the
heart of Tata Motors’ innovation
journey. Through the deployment
of intelligent digital solutions, we
are enhancing vehicle ownership
experience from pre-purchase
engagement to post-sale service.

Generative AI-powered solutions
were deployed to enrich customer
experience. An advanced email
responder was introduced to manage
new customer complaint emails,
generating over 22,000 personalised,
policy-compliant responses. Trained on
historical interactions and enterprise
knowledge, the system reduced
average response time from ~3 hours
to under 5 minutes – ensuring real-time

spanning 400+ dealers across
India, a mobile-first Proof of
Delivery solution‑integrated with
our Transporter Portal and Dealer

Management System — has digitised
last-mile vehicle deliveries. This has
enhanced transparency, enabled
real‑time tracking, and eliminated
manual reconciliation, ensuring
a seamless handover experience
for customers.
We reached 1 million Connected
Commercial vehicles during the year.
This expanding ecosystem enables
us to deliver personalised contextual
recommendations, over-the-air
updates, and intelligent alerts for
predictive maintenance, besides
usage-based promotions, enriching
the ownership journey and fostering
brand affinity.
Through these initiatives,
Tata Motors is driving the transition
to experience‑led mobility, merging
technological innovation with
human‑centred design to create
enduring customer value.

Tata Motors’ continues enduring commitment to future-readiness by embedding AI, data
science, and automation into the heart of our operations, we are creating a more agile,
resilient, and value-driven enterprise one that is equipped to lead the mobility revolution
in an increasingly AI driven world.
Data & AI: Driving an
intelligent, agile enterprise

FY25 was a year of creating a strong
enterprise Infrastructure & Data fabric
to scale the deployment of AI across
critical business functions, enabling
real-time insights, automation,
and agility.
A hybrid private cloud with advanced
voice analytics emerged as a powerful
agent for sales conversion. Processing
over 1,50,000 recorded conversations
in multiple languages, our AI engine
categorised leads based on intent
and sentiment. More than 55,000
high‑potential leads were surfaced
and prioritised, significantly improving
sales response times and boosting
conversion efficiency.
In engineering, AI transformed
traditional product development.
Predictive models simulate real-world
vehicle behaviour, enabling us to
optimise powertrain configurations,
improve fuel efficiency, and accelerate
design validation. These simulations
have reduced reliance on physical
testing, delivering substantial time
and cost savings while enhancing
engineering precision.
Our N=1 pricing strategies, dynamically
tailored discounts and incentives based
on customer behaviour and market
context to enhance competitiveness,
enable sales conversions and
improve realisation.
Together, these initiatives reflect
our commitment to embedding
data intelligence into the core of
our decision-making processes.
By transforming data into actionable
insight, Tata Motors is building a
responsive, agile enterprise equipped
for dynamic market environments.

TML

Materiality assessment
At Tata Motors, we acknowledge the role of materiality assessments in ensuring
that our ESG efforts remain relevant, strategic, and impactful. This year marks a
significant milestone for TML, as we have broadened our approach to materiality
assessments by incorporating the concept of double materiality for the first time.
The double materiality assessment (DMA) has helped us determine which sustainability issues are most
important to the organisation and its stakeholders. It involves evaluating the organisation’s impact on
environmental and social factors (inside-out perspective) and examining how these factors affect the
organisation (outside-in perspective). This dual approach helps the Company identify and prioritise ESG
issues that are both financially important and socially significant, promoting the comprehensive integration of
sustainability into its core strategy. We plan to conduct similar assessments every two years, taking emerging
sustainability issues, global events and other trends into consideration.

Identification
Step 1

TML identified relevant ESG material topics, through stakeholder
consultations, evaluation of ESG frameworks, and an assessment
of the maturity of the organisation’s current practices.

Step 2

For each identified topic, the related impacts, risks, and opportunities
(IROs) were developed across TML’s value chain, informed by research
on past events and forecasts made by think tanks and academia.

Assessment
Step 3

Step 4

An impact and financial assessment was conducted for each IRO, following
the Double Materiality methodology. The impacts were assessed based
on their scale, scope, irremediability, and likelihood, while the risks and
opportunities were evaluated in terms of their magnitude and likelihood.
TML internal and external stakeholders reviewed the IROs and their
associated scores to evaluate their significance and completeness.
Adjustments were made based on the feedback received from
the stakeholders.

Determination
Step 5

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

A final materiality matrix was created based on the scores. A scoring
threshold was established to identify high-priority topics, which were
then further reviewed and confirmed by senior management.

challenges, including: political shifts,
economic swings, trade tensions,
protectionism, wars, terrorism, humanitarian
crises, pandemics and climate-related
disruptions. Given the global nature of where
we sell our finished products and buy our
commodities, the risk landscape is complex,
significant and wide-ranging, particularly in
relation to the challenging and changing tariff
environment. Global tariffs could disrupt
automotive supply chains, overall trade
dynamics, increase raw material costs and
cause recessionary risks.

H

M

F

S

Strategic

We rely on key markets such as the UK, China,
North America, India, and continental Europe
for a significant portion of our revenues. A
decrease in demand in these markets could
harm our business, financial health and
operations.

We continue to closely monitor, assess and
implement mitigation plans in consideration
of the turbulent geopolitical and economic
landscape. This work is underpinned by
foresight intelligence and scenario planning
to look further ahead and build resilience
to alternative futures. Our diverse global
customer base gives us the flexibility to
react to regional changes in demand by
adjusting our sales mix into other markets,
while we may adjust product features or
content should we face supply challenges
informed through our enhanced supply
chain risk management framework.

Our international presence and global sales
profile mean that our business could be
significantly impacted by the global external
environment. Our global supply chain could
also be negatively affected by disruption
caused by external factors. As a result, our
business could be adversely affected through
lower sales of finished vehicles, delays to
deliveries and increasing material costs from
supply chain disruption.

We continue to monitor and assess the
global tariff environments to manage
their ramifications as effectively as
possible, and take mitigating actions
such as implementing cost discipline,
pricing actions, evaluate our offerings and
improving geographical mix.

We are also vulnerable to cyclicity in demand
for our CV business and overall capex and
infrastructure spends.

2 Brand positioning, innovation and rapid technology change

Staying competitive in the dynamic
automotive market is increasingly challenging
due to intensified competition from existing
OEMs and new disruptive entrants, especially
in the EV segment.
Technology in the automotive industry is also
evolving rapidly, particularly with respect to
autonomy, connectivity and electrification.
Our ability to succeed in the future relies
on staying abreast of evolving automotive
trends, meeting changing customer demands
through timely innovation and maintaining
product competitiveness and quality.

F

M

Strategic

Demand for our products can be impacted by
our potential inability to successfully position,
maintain and articulate the strength of our
brands, in addition to our failure to develop
new products and technologies that meet
customer preferences.

At JLR, under the Reimagine strategy our
brands continue our modern luxury vision
to support our position in the market, with
Jaguar relaunching as an all-electric brand
from 2026, targeting a more luxury segment of
the market. As part of the Reimagine strategy,
we are also continuing our collaboration and
partnerships both within the Tata Group and
with external organisations in a number of
areas to meet our customer expectations.

Any delay in the launch of technologically
intensive products, or if the technology in our
products becomes relatively obsolete, could
impact sales as customers move to purchase
products from our competitors.

At the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025,
we unveiled more than 50 next-generation
vehicles, visionary concepts, and intelligent
solutions that redefine the future of
mobility across segments and applications.
We introduced  the ‘Better Always’ mantra for
the Commercial Vehicles business, embodying
our steadfast commitment to all stakeholders
of continuous growth by fostering agility,
challenging limits, striving for excellence, and
embracing relentless improvement.
In the Passenger Vehicles business, with smart
product interventions and timely refreshes
with stylish designs, safety and technology
features, our brand perception has increased
over the years.

3 Electrification transition

Ensuring a smooth, efficient, and costeffective shift that minimises disruptions,
meets regulatory requirements, satisfies
consumer demand and supports
environmental sustainability is paramount.
This involves managing financial,
technological, supply chain and workforce
transitions to maintain competitiveness and
achieve long-term success in the evolving
automotive market. India’s automotive sector
is swiftly transitioning to EVs, driven by
initiatives like the FAME and PLI schemes.

F

M

S

Strategic

An uncontrolled EV transition could lead to
multiple inefficiencies resulting in substantial
financial losses. Examples to include and not
limited to:
Supply Chain Disruptions: Unmanaged supply
chain issues can lead to production delays and
shortages.
Market Share Decline: Inability to meet
consumer demand for BEVs can result in a loss
of market share to more agile competitors.
Regulatory Penalties: Non-compliance with
evolving regulations can lead to fines and legal
challenges.
Reputation Damage: Failure to transition
effectively can harm reputation and brand
value. Further, we are also susceptible to
changes in EV technologies and the risk of any
further alternative fuel technologies, which
could adversely affect our competitive position.

Jaguar Land Rover is making a significant
transition from internal combustion engine
(ICE) vehicles to battery electric vehicles
(BEVs) as part of the Reimagine strategy.
This shift includes the launch of the first fully
electric Range Rover and a new four-door
GT Jaguar BEV in 2026. Additionally, JLR is
making significant continued investment in
upgrading its core facilities and supply chain
for electrification.
At India business, we expanded the
consideration among customers by mitigating
key barriers for EV adoption. Recently, we
have achieved price parity of ICE and EV by
introducing new products at similar prices.
To support the electrification, Tata Group’s
Agratas is constructing battery cell facilities in
UK and India.

4 Growth strategy and competitive business efficiency

Delivering on our business and strategic
objectives is key to realising our planned
future profitability and cash generation
through return on our investments. There are
risks inherent in the delivery of our planned
Reimagine strategy at JLR as we make the
investments to transition our product
portfolio to increase the proportion of
electric vehicles in the future. This includes
our assumptions around the level of customer
demand for our products and delivery of our
products at a competitive cost.
For our domestic Commercial Vehicles
business, we plan to improve the VAHAN
market share and deliver strong double digit
EBITDA margins, high ROCE while reducing
the volatility in business. In Passenger
and Electric Vehicles, the business aspires
to achieve 18-20% market share, deliver
double‑digit EBITDA margins and for PV
(ICE business) with positive and growing cash
flows, and achieve neutral Free Cash flows for
the EV business in the medium term.

F

M

S

Financial

If our business is unable to compete
effectively on costs, then we may experience
lower-than-expected returns on our future
investments. This could inhibit our ability to
achieve our financial objectives.

The JLR Refocus 2.0 transformation programme
supports the delivery of our Reimagine
objectives. This operational transformation
programme, alongside the strengthening of
our existing programme governance, includes
a focus on ensuring timely new product delivery
to market and management of the cost base
of the business while also ensuring that we
maximise profitability on our sales.
We maintain strong liquidity in the business to
ensure that we can navigate funding challenges
which may arise in the future.

In the CV business, we are minimising
discounting and focusing on retail market
share. However, if consumers cannot absorb
price increases or competitors continue
aggressive discounting with better operating
efficiencies, we will be affected. Further, our
market share has witnessed pressure in the
SCV and Pickup segment.

For the domestic CV business, we have modified
our priority to the demand‑pull strategy to
focus on retail market share and minimising
discounts to boost profitability. Also, the
focus is to reduce the impact of volatility in
CV business through non‑vehicular business,
digital, etc. In the Passenger and EV business,
there has been a turnaround and strong
operational cash flows and maintained market
share. With an expansive product portfolio,
smart digital solutions and new nameplate
launches on the anvil, we are well-positioned to
leverage market opportunities and maintain our
growth trajectory.

The PV business is susceptible to
competitive  pressures in terms of new
technologies, features, innovations, etc.
Our lead in EV adoption carries risks too.
If EV adoption stalls or competitors offer
superior technology, features, range
and cost, it could severely impact us.
overall demand growth will be shaped by
macroeconomic factors such as consumption
growth, inflation, infrastructure spending,
taxation, government incentives, and
global geopolitics.

5 Supply chain disruptions and commodity price fluctuations

Our ability to supply components, in
time, to our manufacturing operations
is of paramount importance in achieving
production schedules and meeting consumer
demand. Commodity price fluctuations,
being a major part of overall costs, might
impact the cost competitiveness and overall
profitability. Lastly, the volatile nature of
the regulatory landscape (Tariffs) could
also result in significant direct and indirect
impacts to suppliers and disruption to
logistics that increase production costs and
lead times.

F

M

Operational

Supply chain disruptions, if not managed,
could have an adverse effect on production
volume, revenue and profitability, customer
satisfaction and reputation. Continued supply
constraints have impacted many industries,
including automotive. Higher inflation
caused by the scarcity and rising cost of raw
materials, commodities, energy and transport
is impacting the production of goods.

The industrialisation of JLR’s risk management
framework has improved its time to recover
from events impacting its global value chains
as well as communication. JLR continues
to actively engage its internal teams and
suppliers to mitigate potential disruption
through our Secure26, and Kass programmes
(Tier 1+ Financial Risk detection). We are
diversifying sourcing, driving localisation of
critical components, closely collaborating
with suppliers and building a buffer stock,
exercising financial instruments such as futures
or options contracts for hedging against price
increases and negotiating long‑term contracts,
wherever necessary. Material cost reduction
through Value Analysis and Value Engineering
(VAVE) is also part of our strategy. We are also
working on localisation of routine components
to minimise the risk.

S

6 IT systems, security and data management

We are exposed to IT risks since IT plays an
important role in our operations, including
the manufacturing, design of engineering
processes. With our vehicles becoming
increasingly technologically advanced and
connected to the internet, they may become
more susceptible to unauthorised access. The
ever-growing threat from cybercrime and the
spread of aggressive malicious code brings
risks that can affect the availability, integrity
and confidentiality of information and
IT‑supported operating resources We are also
subject to risks related to legacy IT systems
and system migration projects. As data
and digitisation continue to advance within
our products and services, protecting our
information assets and maintaining secure
information services are critical enterprise
enablers for the benefit of our customers and
company’s resilience.

H

M

F

S

Operational

As data and digitisation continue to advance
within organisation and our products and
services, protecting our information assets
and maintaining secure information services
are critical enterprise enablers for the benefit
of our customers and resilience. Failure
to implement effective data management
practices leaves the Company exposed to
the risk of regulatory fines and reputational
harm. Our ability to meet customer needs,
expectations and address future challenges
will be hindered, potentially leading to
decreased investment, loss of market share
and reduced business performance. The risk
impacts can be categorised into four main
areas at a macro level:
Strategic risk: Loss/theft of IP leading to longterm value loss.
Operational risk: A severe ransomware
attack could result in business disruption and
loss of revenue.
Financial risk: Breach of compliance could
lead to major fines and operational sanctions
being imposed.
Reputational risk: Negative media publicity
resulting in loss of customers and long-term
customer trust impact.

Information risk and cyber security are
managed strategically. Through a cohesive
programme of initiatives, we mitigate
significant business risks while positively
influencing business and brand value, growth,
stability, and overall success. We continue
to drive measurable improvements in cyber
defence and other core security capabilities
(e.g., security ecosystem, supply chain
security, risk governance and cultural
change). We are committed to safeguarding
our data assets through specialist data
governance capabilities, ensuring all our data
assets are owned, controlled and accessible
across the Company, and our employees
have the skills, tools, and support to enact.
Promoting Data Management through
an appropriate Data policy, standards
and controls demonstrate company’s
dedication to sustainable growth so we
are ready for the future. With appropriate
awareness we can maximise our ability to
exploit new technologies and use AI safely
and responsibly.

7 People capability and capacity

To deliver strategic and operational plans
an organisation needs a workforce with
core and critical skills in both current and
emerging areas and a culture underpinned
by a safe, secure and inclusive environment
that enables people to do their best work
every day. The safety, wellbeing and
engagement of our employees is paramount
and needs to be maintained in the face of a
challenging external environment.

H

M

F

I

Operational

If we are unable to attract, engage, develop
and retain the best diverse talent and
critical skills in an increasingly competitive
environment, our ability to continually
innovate and deliver products and services
to our customers will be impacted.

An essential part of our strategy is to
cultivate an agile and capable organisation
and culture through changes in our work
methods, significant upskilling in ACES
(Autonomous, Connected, Electric, Shared),
and introducing a new business purpose and
supporting behaviours. Our culture is built on
four pillars: Be Bold, Own It, Solve Together
and Being Empathetic. We remain dedicated
to fostering an environment that drives
exceptional business performance.
We also continue to respond to the rapidly
evolving technological landscape. We are
focused on taking a sustainable approach to
planning for the future. By building through
our early careers, talent attraction and talent
upskilling programmes, we ensure our people
have the skills and capabilities we need.

8 Distribution channels, retailer network and customer service delivery

Our goal is to ensure every customer
experiences a seamless and consistent
hassle-free journey, delighting them at every
interaction. Retailer partners play a crucial
role in reflecting our brand strategy and
vision, effectively communicating our values
through trained and capable representatives.
This approach aims to successfully appeal
to new and existing customers, driving high
customer satisfaction and retention levels
in both sales and services. Availability of
parts is necessary to ensure a seamless
customer experience.

Inconsistent customer experience impacts
our ability to attract and retain customers
and and impacts overall customer
satisfaction. Failure to deliver an exceptional
experience through our online and physical
retailer channels will lead to a weakening
in our competitive positioning, potentially
impacting our business and financial
performance as a result. This situation
may necessitate investments in evolving
distribution models like D2C to meet
evolving consumer preferences and market
trends continuously.

Operational

Market demand is monitored constantly to
optimise vehicle and parts and accessory
deliveries for our retailers and customers.
Online customer experience is being
enhanced and simplified. Retailer systems
and tools are being enhanced, supporting
retailer sales, service and technician
representatives to deliver a seamless and
consistent hassle-free customer experience.
Other initiatives such as SOTA (Software Over
the Air) and FOTA (Features Over The Air)
services, Fleet Edge, Sampoorna Seva 2.0, and
Uptime Guarantee have been implemented
to improve sales and aftersales experiences.
Additionally, exclusive Tata.ev stores
provide an immersive experience to the
EV community. In Passenger Vehicles
business, initiatives are underway to
expand service capabilities and improve
customer experience.

9 Climate change

Strategic

Description

Consequences

Mitigations and opportunities

The transition away from traditional fossil
fuels to renewable energy sources – and
the increasing pace of that transition –
creates particular compliance challenges,
in particular tailpipe emissions for
automotive companies and wider compliance
requirements for carbon emissions produced
during manufacturing and other operations.
Climate change presents both acute and
chronic physical risks to our operations and
value chain.

We may incur significant reputational
damage, which could materially impact
our brands and sales, if we fail to maintain
environmental compliance. Regulatory and
governmental policy changes may introduce
additional operational costs in the form of
carbon pricing and taxation. Rising frequency
of extreme weather events and global
warming can directly and indirectly impact
our supply chains and operations, potentially
hindering our ability to meet demand.

Tata Motors acknowledges the short, medium
and long-term physical and transition risks
associated with climate change. Our ambition
to achieve net zero GHG emissions for our
Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Commercial Vehicle
(CV) businesses by 2040 and 2045 respectively
will contribute to fulfilling India’s stated
aspiration of achieving net zero GHG emissions
by 2070.
JLR is transforming its business with the aim
to become carbon net zero across its supply
chain, products and operations by 2039. We are
proactive in meeting environmental regulations
and compliance, seeing each regulatory change
as an opportunity to enhance product value
and meet stakeholder aspirations.

It also poses transition risks to our business,
including technological advancements in
products and changes in the market and
policy landscape.

Driving net zero

The climate crisis is no longer a distant
risk — it is a defining reality of our
time. FY25 has deepened our resolve
to transform how we move people and
goods, how we build products, and
how we engage with the planet. As the
world accelerates toward clean energy,
circular systems, and climate‑resilient
business models, Tata Motors is
not just adapting — we are leading
the way.
Guided by science and driven by
purpose, we are advancing a bold
decarbonisation journey. We remain on
course to achieve Net Zero emissions
by 2040 for our Passenger Vehicles
(PV) business and by 2045 for our
Commercial Vehicles (CV) business.
Our commitment to RE100 continues
to gain momentum, with a clear
roadmap to power all operations with
100% renewable electricity by 2030.
FY25 has been a breakthrough year
for zero-emission technologies.
Hydrogen has moved from lab to road:
we’ve initiated pilot trials of hydrogen

Our Energy Management Programme
is central to our sustainability
strategy, focusing on reducing
energy consumption and improving
efficiency. We are consistently working
to enhance energy performance
through internal audits that identify
opportunities for improvement.
We have established clear, measurable
targets for reducing energy use —
targets that are closely aligned with
our broader sustainability objectives
and reviewed regularly to ensure we
stay on track.
Energy conservation is achieved
through the optimised use of power
and fossil fuels, as well as improved
energy productivity via Energy
Conservation (ENCON) projects. These
initiatives are implemented across our
plants and offices in a planned and
budgeted manner, contributing to both
cost reduction and climate change
mitigation through the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions.
Crucial to this effort is identifying
investments in new technologies
and methods that have the potential
to significantly reduce energy
consumption while maintaining
operational efficiency.

Pioneering circular economies

In FY24, TML launched Tatva – a
comprehensive framework to  
becoming a truly circular business. In
the absence of a universally accepted
international standard or framework,
TATVA was created to embed
circularity in our core operations.
Tatva represents the integration of
circular economy principles across
the enterprise — impacting design,
engineering, procurement, customer
care, aftermarket services, and end-oflife management.
The framework is structured under
three key action areas: Carbon
Efficiency, Resource Efficiency, and

Revenue Generation, four pathways –
Material, Energy, Lifetime & Utilisation,
and 12 key elements supported by
22 robust metrics.
To establish a strong foundation for
Carbon and Resource Efficiency, we
have established baseline data across
all our platforms and developed a
targeted commodity strategy aligned
with our ambitious 2030 goals. These
initiatives are integral to our ‘Design
for Circularity’ approach. Furthermore,
renewable energy has been adopted
as a central theme to drive carbon
efficiency throughout our supply chain.

On the revenue front, we have
launched Project Sanjeevani to
expand our Prolife product portfolio
and unlock new value streams from
circular models. Simultaneously, we
are enhancing the capabilities of our
Re.Wi.Re centres by implementing
processes that enable components
to move through higher loops
of circularity — such as Reuse,
Refurbishment, and Remanufacturing
— rather than going directly to
recycling. Going forward, we
will strengthen our value chain
partnerships to advance circularity
and introduce solutions that enhance
the utilisation and lifecycle value of
our products.

Circularity through design

We are committed to upholding
sustainable practices in our
end‑of‑life product management
strategies. We continuously
strive to improve our products’
circularity quotient by embedding
design‑for‑recycling approaches,
facilitating easy dismantling and
selection of sustainable materials.
TML has developed a comprehensive
strategy to embed material circularity
throughout the lifecycle of our
vehicles. This involves a fundamental
shift towards modular designs,
enabling efficient disassembly and
promoting component reuse and
remanufacturing. Our design-forrecycling approach seeks to minimise
waste and environmental impact.
In order to promote end-of‑life
management of our products, the
dismantling information of, Nexon,
Altroz, Aria, Indica, Indigo, Indica
vista, Harrier, Safari, Nexon EV, Curvv
EV, Tigor EV is published on IDIS
(International Dismantling Information
System) website. This information
is useful to dismantlers for the safe
disposal of Tata vehicles.
Sustainable materials encompass use
of recyclable materials, encouraging
use of recycled materials, restricted
use of hazardous materials and
use of materials with low carbon
intensity. Currently, over 90% of
materials used in our commercial and
passenger vehicles are recyclable and
recoverable. We are continuously
striving to enhance use of recycled
material content for our vehicles.
Our passenger and commercial
vehicles use varied percentages of
recycled content in steel, aluminium,
glass and polymers. The average
recycled content of our passenger and
commercial vehicles is in the range
of 5 to 8% covering 5 ICE models
(Tiago, Tigor, Altroz, Punch, Nexon) and
3 CV platforms (SCV, ILMCV and HCV).
To further strengthen our efforts, we’re
also actively developing closed‑loop
recycling systems for critical materials
like metals, plastics, oil, and rubber
to reduce our dependence on
virgin resources.

REPORT

Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)

In line with our commitment to sustainability, Tata Motors conducts thorough
Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to evaluate the environmental impacts of our
products. These assessments cover resource use, ecological consequences such
as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ecotoxicity, as well as human health
considerations including human toxicity and ionising radiation. LCA’s quantify these
impacts using metrics such as Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential,
Eutrophication, Abiotic Depletion, Ozone Layer Depletion, and Photochemical
Ozone Creation.

LCA methodology and approach

Our LCA approach, adhering to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards,
comprehensively evaluates the total environmental impacts or ecological burden
arising from the entire lifecycle of our products. This includes stages from raw
material extraction through manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life disposal.
We have completed Cradle to Gate LCA analysis for various passenger ICE and
EV vehicle models (Tiago, Tigor, Altroz, Punch, Nexon, Curvv, Harrier MCE and
Safari MCE, Nexon EV, Tiago EV, Tigor EV, Punch EV, Curvv EV).
To understand the life-cycle impact of EV battery cells, TML has performed
Cradle-to-Gate LCA analysis with the help of a third party consultant to evaluate
global supply chain impact of battery manufacturing and the effect of different
manufacturing locations i.e. China and India.
For our commercial vehicles, we have completed cradle to gate LCA analysis
for representative vehicles from SCV, ILMCV & HCV platforms which includes
assessments of material usage, energy consumption, and emissions. The transition
to alternate fuels is also a very important factor in reducing the carbon footprint
of Tata Motors commercial vehicles, and this is also taken into account while
conducting LCA analysis.
These LCA studies help us to identify ‘hotspots’ where environmental impacts
are most significant, enabling targeted improvements to reduce product carbon
footprint, minimise waste generation and promote use of sustainable materials.
We have systematically embedded these objectives in our product development
process by setting decarbonisation and material circularity targets for future
passenger and commercial vehicle models.

Nexon ICE - An LCA landmark

We have established a new benchmark in environmental reporting transparency
with the successful third-party verification of our Cradle-to-Grave LCA for Nexon
Diesel model by TUV-Rheinland. The Cradle-to-Grave LCA study follows ISO 14040
and 14044 method covering all the life cycle phases – material extraction & part
manufacturing processes, upstream transport, vehicle production, downstream
distribution, fuel consumption and emissions during life of the product, preventive
and extensive maintenance, disassembly and treatment of ELV. The outcome of the
LCA indicates total life cycle climate change impact for Nexon Diesel as ~ 0.21 kg
CO₂e/km, with key contributions from the use phase, material extraction, and
component manufacturing. Third party validation ensures data accuracy and
methodological integrity strengthening our ability to make informed decisions and
demonstrate commitment to environment to our stakeholders.

Waste management
Tata Motors is committed to
sustainable waste management,
implementing a comprehensive
internal auditing process that
categorises waste and its disposal
routes. Automobile manufacturing
operations generate wastes and scrap.  
Scrap has inherent material value and
can be re-recycled. Waste is regulated
by law based on its characteristics and
includes both hazardous and nonhazardous types.

A significant part of our waste
management programme includes
employee training on circularity in
waste management, identification
of new technologies and methods to
minimise waste and divert waste from
landfills. These efforts are helping all
Plants to achieve the ‘Zero Waste to
Landfill’ target by 2030.

Our operations continuously drive
initiatives aimed at eliminating,
minimising, and recycling waste in
accordance with legal requirements
and available opportunities with
quantified targets cascaded to
operational sites. These initiatives
include material recovery through
authorised recyclers, co-processing
hazardous waste as alternative fuel and
raw material and recycling of metal and
non-metal scrap through authorised
recyclers.

Preserving nature and biodiversity

TML’s biodiversity strategy is aligned
with the Groups Aalingana strategy,
metrics and milestones, and puts in
place an Action Plan for delivering a
Net Positive Impact on biodiversity. At
an enterprise level, this strategy lays
down the steps to restore, enhance,
and protect nature, ensuring a net
positive outcome on biodiversity.
TMLs understanding of biodiversity
and species extinction began with
Top Management engaging with
leading Subject Matter Experts and
practitioners, which in turn informed
our decision to adopt a science-based
approach as opposed to the ad-hoc and
charismatic. Strategic coherence led to
the identification of 3 areas for TMLs
biodiversity interventions which spans
(1) its own Operations, (2) its Value
Chain and (3) beyond the Value Chain
extending to the national landscape
and aligning with national conservation
priorities. For each of these areas, we
adopted scientific frameworks and

concepts, built ambition in line with
our aspiration to move the needle and
established baselines.
In FY25 we launched projects across
all 3 areas, which have strategic
relevance and potential to deliver
impact at scale. The projects are
conceptualised to deliver scientifically
validated approaches (as SOP’s) ready
for implementation; for example
eco‑restoration of disturbed habitats
or improving the health of threatened
wetlands. Such initiatives, which
leverage nature and productive
ecosystems to protect people and
biodiversity, constitute what are
called Nature based Solution (NbS)
projects. In the scale-up phase of
this unique strategic approach, Tata
Motors plans to engage Value Chain
partners and corporate peers, to
adopt and implement these SOPs in
similar landscapes, while continuing
to provide stewardship, enable
convergence funding and monitor
impact. This strategy will realise Tata
Motors and the Groups objective of
investing in NbS projects in India to
deliver biodiversity and community
co-benefits.

A) Own operations

Since inception, all TML Operational
sites in India have demarcated
dedicated areas on which green‑belt
and wetlands are developed. A
comprehensive biodiversity baseline
survey across all Plants was carried
out to get an in-depth understanding
of- current floristic and faunal diversity,
extent of invasive species, presence
of species with special conservation
value and other challenges. At our
Pimpri Residential Area, in Pune, a
comprehensive eco-restoration master
plan supported by scientific metrics
is developed, which will be executed
in FY26 to achieve measurable
improvements in biodiversity on‑site.
These eco-restoration projects are
structured to meet the criteria laid
down in the MoEFCC-NBA-UNDP

backed OECM framework (i.e. Other
Effective Area Based Conservation
Measures) – which expands the scope
of area-based conservation beyond
legally protected areas. Going beyond
certification, these Tata Motors ‘nature
hot-spots’ set in the midst of industrial
estates, will serve as a light‑house
of best practice in biodiversity
conservation. Tata Motors will
engage with its employees and local
stakeholders in the process enabling
awareness-building, research, and
adoption to create a ripple effect far
beyond its premises.

B) Value chain

Automobile manufacturing sources
a diverse range of parts, materials
and consumables from a complex
global supply chain. This sourcing
determines the level of both
dependency and impact on nature
and natural resources. To address
this, Tata Motors has joined the
corporate engagement programme
of Science‑Based Targets for Nature.
The Science based Targets Network
(SBTN) is developing Science‑Based
Targets for Nature for companies to
address their environmental impacts
across terrestrial, freshwater, and
marine realms, in addition to climate.  
This structured approach will help
Tata Motors reduce its contribution to
key drivers of nature loss. In FY25, we
have identified material impacts of our
operations and those of our immediate
upstream value chain on nature
and biodiversity. We are using tools

90

and databases to interpret these material pressures/impacts to ensure a holistic
prioritisation, paving the way to set SBTN aligned public commitments and targets.
By taking this stand in the public domain, Tata Motors aims to showcase the role of
scientific rigor, inspiring broader industry action in India.

2)

Maximus – Asian elephants are
India’s national heritage animal
for good reason – apart from its
cultural and religious importance,
they are a keystone species
of biodiversity conservation!
Project Maximus, is Tata Motors
elephant conservation
programme currently active in
two landscapes- the Singhbhum
Elephant Reserve in Jharkhand
and the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve
in the south. The approach
includes providing on-ground
resources for securing conflict
affected communities in the
short term and collaborations
for science based conservation
through field studies in the
long term. This NbS project
will deliver new scientific
knowledge in the form of updated
baselines, mapping of elephant
habitats, migration patterns,
conflict zones, as well as sitespecific and regional mitigation
plans to establish scalable
‘co‑existence’ models.

3)

Go Green – Natural habitats
and biodiversity in Northeast
India are under pressure due to
extensive deforestation, shifting
cultivation, and infrastructure
development. In FY25, 7.1 lakh
saplings have been planted and
protected across 700 acres in
Longleng District of Nagaland
under Tata Motors flagship ‘Go
Green’ project in collaboration
with Lemsachenlok, a grassroots
community organisation. This
community-led plantation on
degraded jhum fallow lands,
utilises indigenous knowledge
of local communities to restore
land cover with indigenous tree
species. This NbS project will
deliver restoration of degraded
lands which builds ecological
resilience and secures livelihoods
of indigenous communities that
rely on forests for sustenance and
cultural practices.

Project Maximus launched in Kerala’s Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.

C) Beyond value chain

Tata Motors is demonstrating leadership by addressing Nature and Biodiversity
beyond its Operations and Value Chain in line with our ambition to create impact
at scale. After evaluating a wide range of potential topics, we shortlisted 3 projects
which are aligned with the Kunming Montreal-Global Biodiversity Framework and
has potential to create impact at scale.
1)      Wetlands & Winged Voyagers – Wetlands along the path of the Central Asian
Flyway in India, are critical wintering habitats for millions of migratory birds,
providing food and safe resting areas. Securing these wetlands is essential
for the continuance of the annual global migration and avian biodiversity.
In collaboration with Wetlands International South Asia (WISA), the wetland
landscape around four of our Plants- Pune, Sanand, Lucknow, and Jamshedpur
were studied using satellite image analysis, thematic overlays and on-ground
ecological evaluation leading to prioritisation of 1,800 wetlands for further
study. The outcomes will include Health Card creation aligned with India’s
National Wetland Portal and development of integrated management
programmes for high priority wetlands. This NbS project will deliver wetland
positive landscapes, and contribute to India’s national and international
wetland commitments, while saving habitats for avian biodiversity at
a global scale.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

Tata Motors remains steadfast in
promoting equal opportunities
within the organisation and beyond.
Building upon our long-standing
legacy through our programmes and
inclusive practices, we strive to create
a workplace culture where every
individual feels valued, respected,
and empowered to unlock their
true potential.

DEIsha architecture
and governance

To ensure DEI is strategised, owned and
implemented by all stakeholders, we have
established a strong governance structure
to ensure accountability, transparency, and
alignment with organisational vision through
DEIsha. It helps drive meaningful change,
monitor progress, and address systemic
inequities effectively.

Tata Motors follows an ‘Equal
Opportunity Employer Policy’ and
launched a formal DEI programme
called DEIsha (Direction) in FY24.
Under this, TML has several policies
and programmes in place that ensure
flexibility, parent-friendliness, worklife balance while also taking care of
healthcare needs and the special needs
of new mothers and opportunities
for women interested in returning to
the workplace after career breaks.
Our future-focused perspective is
reflected in the benefits we offer to
our employees’ partners, and not just
their spouses.

Employee relations

Strong employee relations form the bedrock of sustained growth and operational
excellence in our organisation. We have established workmen unions across seven
of our plants (Except Dharwad site), which actively engage in Joint Forums meetings
with the Management at multiple levels. These forums serve as a platform for
constructive dialogue and joint resolution of concerns related to workmen. Our
commitment to our workforce goes beyond daily operations. We ensure:
• Social protection coverage for the workmen
• Wages aligned with industry benchmarks, ensuring fairness
and competitiveness
• Capability building initiatives aimed at preparing our teams for future industrial
transitions and technological shifts. Our 100% sponsored higher education
programme for workmen is designed to support their aspirations for growth
and prepare them for higher roles
Our reward and recognition framework is designed to promote fairness and equity,
ensuring the uniform application of remuneration guidelines.

Wage settlement

Tata Motors fosters strong and
collaborative industrial relations
with its seven employee unions,
representing over 15,000 technicians.
Open dialogue, mutual respect, and
joint forums help address challenges
and align on shared goals. In FY25,
five long-term, productivity-linked
settlements were successfully signed at
Lucknow, Sanand-1, Sanand-2, TMBSL
Lucknow and Dharwad — reflecting
our commitment to inclusive growth,
future-readiness, and sustained
partnership between management
and workforce.

future-focused trades like Vehicle
Software Technicians and Additive
Manufacturing Technicians currently
being developed in collaboration with
government agencies.
The programme combines rigorous
technical training at our plant‑based
training centres, hands‑on experience
in manufacturing environments,
and exposure to service operations.
A comprehensive governance
framework ensures that apprentices
are monitored for academic
performance, practical skills,
discipline, and development of soft
skills. We currently have 216 FTAs in
the programme, with 50% women

Utkarsha and Vidyadhan —
Empowering the future of our
employees’ families

Driving shopfloor excellence
through self-directed teams and
self-managed teams

As an organisation committed to
inclusive growth and the upliftment
of our extended workforce families,
we launched two meaningful
schemes — Utkarsha and Vidyadhan
— focused on empowering the
wards of our technician employees
through education.

• At Tata Motors, we continue to
nurture a culture of ownership,
accountability, and empowerment
on the shopfloor through the
implementation of Self-Directed
Teams (SDTs) and Self-Managed
Teams (SMTs). These teams,
independently run by technicians
and contract workmen, are
central to driving performance
and fostering a participative work
environment across our plants.
• Operating with a high degree of
autonomy, SDTs and SMTs are
empowered to take proactive
ownership of critical pillars such
as Safety, Quality, Productivity,
Delivery, Cost, Morale, and
Environment (SQPDCME) within
their work areas. This structure
enables team members to identify
opportunities, solve problems at
the source, and take swift action
aligned with organisational goals.
• Beyond operational efficiency, this
initiative significantly enhances
engagement and collaboration
with our business partners,
reinforcing mutual respect, shared
responsibility, and transparency.
• The culture of SDTs and SMTs
ensures that the Company’s
Balanced Scorecard (BSC),
objectives, and communication
are effectively cascaded to every
individual on the ground.
• This bottom-up approach
is a cornerstone in our
journey toward operational
excellence, sustainable growth,
and building a truly agile,
empowered organisation.

• Under the Utkarsha programme,
we provide scholarships for
the daughters of technician
employees. So far, 524 girls have
benefitted from this initiative,
with a total disbursement of I1.3
crore, helping them pursue their
academic aspirations.
• Through the Vidyadhan
programme, in partnership with
the State Bank of India (SBI) the
largest bank in India, we facilitate
education loans at concessional
interest rates for higher education.
To date, I1.38 crore in loans has
been granted to 77 students under
this scheme.
These initiatives reflect our continued
commitment to education, equity,
and empowerment for our extended
TML family.

In addition to core technical expertise,
apprentices receive training in safety,
communication, problem-solving,
TQM, Kaizen, WCQ, and other
operational excellence methodologies.
Upon successful completion,
top‑performers are offered roles in
key operational functions and are
supported by the Company’s Pragati
higher education programme, ensuring
continuous career growth within
the organisation.

We have 216 FTAs in
the programme, with
50% representation of
women, highlighting our
commitment to diversity.

A win-win cultural assimilation

Following its successful acquisition and
assimilation into Tata Motors, the new
Sanand facility has now transitioned
into full-fledged production.
This marks a significant milestone in
our growth journey.
To enable a seamless integration and
empower the workforce, multiple
initiatives have been rolled out across
key focus areas — Culture, Capability
Building, Higher Education, Health
& Well-being, and Collaboration
& Communication. These efforts are
aimed at fostering a cohesive work
environment, aligned with Tata Motors’
values, and building a future-ready,

Wellness at Tata Motors

Employee well-being remains a key pillar of our people strategy. Under our Health
& Wellness initiatives, we have adopted a comprehensive, prevention-focused
approach to promote long-term physical and mental health.
• Through primordial prevention measures such as digital wellness programmes,
cardiac Q risk assessments, wellness coaching, and canteen menu
transformation, we are building a foundation for healthier lifestyles.
• Primary prevention initiatives — including tobacco cessation, weight
management, and pre-diabetes detection — aim to address health risks early.
• The secondary prevention efforts like stress testing and chronic disease control
help in effective monitoring and timely intervention.

TML received ‘Corporate
Wellbeing Excellence
Award’ by jury members
of Global Mental Health

Tata Motors operates with the unwavering belief that Safety & Wellbeing is not
just a priority, but a non-negotiable condition of doing business. This commitment
is embedded across all business verticals — from manufacturing and mobility
services to product development and after-sales. Our organisation is guided by a
robust ISO 45001:2018-aligned Occupational Health & Safety Management System
(OHSMS) and a multi-tiered Safety, Health & Sustainability (SHS) governance
framework, ensuring leadership accountability and safety integration from
boardrooms to shop floors and safety is integrated into every decision, operation,
and engagement.
In a validation of Tata Motors’ progress toward safety maturity, an external agency
dss+ conducted a Rapid Safety System Assessment across four pillars: Leadership,
Integrated Governance, Incident Management, and Business Partner Management
in FY25 and observed strong strategic intent, robust governance alignment, and
visible leadership commitment across all levels.

Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA)
At Tata Motors, safety is a core organisational value and a strategic business
priority. Tata Motors implements a systematic and dynamic HIRA process to
proactively identify, assess, and control workplace hazards. This approach is
fundamental to driving a Zero Harm Culture and forms the backbone of our safety
risk management framework.
All worker activities are mapped and assessed based on task complexity, incident
history, and operational exposure. Risk Levels are categorised as Trivial, Tolerable,
Moderate, Substantial, or Intolerable, and risk levels are determined using severity
and likelihood matrices.

operations — positioning Tata Motors
as future-ready and risk-resilient.

People and culture
Advancing safety standards
towards achieving zero harm

Tata Motors remains steadfast in
fostering a world-class safety culture,
prioritising the well-being of our
employees and stakeholders across all
facets of operations. Our commitment
was prominently reflected during the
2023 Tata Group Workshop, where
safety discussions with the Chairman
took centre stage.
Throughout FY25, the Zero Incident
Plan continued to be a cornerstone
of our safety strategy, comprising 31
focused themes and 51 major actions,
each led by a senior leader to ensure
sustained effectiveness.
A robust governance framework
supports multi-tier safety reviews:
• The SHS Committee of the Board
serves as the apex review body.
• Monthly reviews are conducted
by the SHE Councils and Apex
Committees at each plant.
• Dedicated safety assessments are
also undertaken at defined intervals
in non-manufacturing functions,
including Customer Service and
Warehouse operations.

led to a notable reduction in injuries.
Initiatives like Drive Zero focused
on high-risk areas such as defensive
driving and pre-use safety checks.

(SDT) achievements and risk
perception training reinforced
capability‑building and
frontline ownership.

On the digital front, we continued
advancing the use of AI and video
analytics-based applications for
predictive safety insights. Our longterm Business Partner Strategy
includes integrated Business Partner
(Contractor) Safety Management,
ensuring clear accountability and
optimal utilisation of safety resources.

Despite our ongoing efforts,
we regret to announce that there
was one workplace-related fatal
incident during FY25. The incident
was thoroughly investigated, and
systemic corrective actions were
implemented company-wide to
prevent recurrence.

Engagement with business partners
remained a critical focus area.
Targeted initiatives like Contractor
Employee Safety Drives addressed
high-risk categories, while structured
engagements improved safety
ownership and visibility.
Under the People and Performance
theme, we continued to empower
our workforce through structured
training programmes, leadership
communication, and recognition
initiatives. Self-Directed Team

Our TRCFR trend continues to
reflect a significant long-term
improvement, declining from 1.39
in FY21 to 0.47 in FY25 Actuals,
representing a 29% improvement
from 0.66 in FY24. Additionally, the
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate
(LTIFR) for FY25 was 0.13, a 35%
reduction compared to 0.20 in
FY24. These results highlight Tata
Motors’ continued commitment to
strengthening safety standards and
reducing workplace injuries.

To reinforce our commitment to a
strong safety culture, we engaged
external experts DSS+ to conduct a
rapid safety assessment across select
plants. This initiative helped us identify
actionable gaps and strengthen our
overall approach to safety.
Our strategy was centred around
proactive governance and building
a Zero Harm Culture by reinforcing
visible safety leadership behaviours
across all levels of the organisation.
In Operations and Risk Management,
our Critical to Safety (CTS) and
Model Areas Initiative demonstrated
exemplary leadership engagement,
with strong adherence to safety
protocols and behaviours.

The community is not
just another stakeholder
in the business but is, in
fact, the very purpose of
its existence.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

India’s ability to reduce poverty and inequality in the next two
decades is critical for global prosperity. We have an unprecedented
chance to use tools like AI and public data infrastructure to address
development gaps, and to scale local solutions when it comes to
challenges like climate adaptation. At the same time, India is the
first country in the world to enshrine corporate giving into law.
Long before corporate giving became law, the Tata Group has
played a pivotal role in India’s development journey, shaping the
nation through institution-building and contributions to economic
and social progress. Today, the Group is leveraging technology and
innovation to tackle emerging challenges such as climate change
and environmental conservation, while continuing to deepen its
efforts within communities to solve complex social challenges like
access to education and healthcare.
Between FY21 and FY25, the Tata Group invested over
I7,550 crore ($1 Bn) in corporate social responsibility initiatives.
In FY25 alone, the Tata Group’s CSR initiatives impacted over
five million lives across the country — a testament to the Group’s
continued commitment to driving sustainable and equitable
development. As our philanthropic scope has matured and
advanced, so has our approach. Today, we differentiate our efforts
by solving complex problems at scale; serving the underserved;
harmonising people and planet; and harnessing technology to
amplify indigenous solutions.

116

Solving complex challenges at scale

With a proven legacy of social impact
and our footprint of existing operations
in India and globally, we are uniquely
positioned to drive large-scale,
transformative change through our
philanthropic initiatives. Through
long‑term, lifecycle investments in
health, education, community wellbeing and economic empowerment
- our big bets - we aspire to catalyse
change that can break intergenerational
cycles of poverty and create long-term,
sustainable impact.

Serving the underserved

Communities and their well-being have
always been integral to our commitment
to building strong links between our
businesses and social responsibility.
We deepen this commitment by
prioritising geographies and Groups that
have been historically excluded from
mainstream development. Using the
Tata Affirmative Action Policy (TAAP),
the Group has created pathways for
inclusive growth and long-term impact,
reflecting its commitment to fostering
equity and opportunity.

Tata Steel’s Project MANSI (Maternal
and Newborn Survival Initiative) trains
and equips social health workers (ASHA)
to provide life-saving maternal and
newborn care. MANSI now covers 1,700
villages across Jharkhand and Odisha
and is significantly improving maternal
and child health services in remote
areas. Tata Motors runs the Malnutrition
Treatment Centre (MTC) in Jharkhand
with the state government.

Tata AutoComp’s Café Dil and IHCL’s
Blind Bakes Café are initiatives that
empower neurodivergent and visually
impaired youths by providing handson skilling in barista training, café
management, and social interaction.
These initiatives create real-world
employment opportunities while
promoting corporate sensitivity and
inclusive workforce practices.

Titan Kanya has empowered over
65,000 young women through quality
learning opportunities since 2013, while
TCS’s Literacy as a Service (LaaS) has
scaled to reach more than one million
people, fostering lifelong learning and
economic empowerment.

Harmonising people and planet

Our skilling programme, Tata STRIVE, has
focused on providing underprivileged
communities access to quality skill
training with an aim to enable livelihood
linkages. The programme has touched
over 1.8 million lives across 21 states
over the past decade.

Integrated rural development programme

First launched in Palghar in 2018, Tata Motors has expanded the Integrated
Village Development Programme across geographies. Amongst the early
beneficiaries, farmers like Chandrakant Andher from Jawhar is one among the
many Lakhpati farmers who have benefitted through multiple interventions
and leveraged government schemes to enhance their quality of life.
Similarly, CSR team at Pune, under its IVDP at Ambegaon, has implemented a
solar irrigation on 30-32 acres of farmland. Farmers who were first to adopt are
seeing their expenses decline and reporting almost double the income from
I60,000 to I1,60,000.
Taking a decisive stride, Tata Motors is replicating the IVDP
programme in Shravasti (UP), ranked lowest amongst socio-economic
development indicators.

Tata Affirmative Action
Programme (TAAP)

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

The Tata Affirmative Action Programme (TAAP) refers to initiatives
by Tata Companies in India for greater inclusion of disadvantaged
sections of society. TAAP focuses on groups which have been
socially and economically disadvantaged due to historical reasons/
displacement. Their access to opportunities, services and benefits
in society are limited and therefore they are socially excluded.
In TAAP, the current focus includes the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, Persons with Disabilities and women from
marginalised communities. As the name suggests, Affirmative
action (AA) is an enabler to address the inherent disadvantage an
AA community faces. The pursuit of Affirmative actions is to create
equality of opportunity through creating access for disadvantaged
(AA) communities.
In 2007 in the Tata Group established the Tata Group Forum
on Affirmative Action. This was aligned with the CII taskforce
on Affirmative Action which continues till today which
recommended the industry to take systematic and time-bound
initiatives to enable SC/ST youth to realise their potential.
Beginning 2010 onwards, TAAP Assessment process was started
on the lines of the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM).
The objective of the external assessments was to further
embed AA in Tata companies and hold up best practices for
emulation. This was named the TAAP- Tata Affirmative
Action Programme Assessment.
The Tata Group AA policy was updated in
2020 with an emphasis on Equal opportunity,
Equity and Inclusion.

In addition there is emphasis on social security benefits or financial inclusivity.
This is to avail government schemes like, health/life insurances, basic entitlements
like Aadhar and PAN cards.

Key functions of the organisation which
need to work closely to embed TAAP

Since TAAP is aimed to create the mindset of equity and inclusion in the
organisation, everyone needs to be sensitised about the subject. Having said that,
the key functions to deploy TAAP policy are (I) Chief Sustainability Officer or Chief
CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) (ii) Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) (iii)
Chief of Procurement Officer (CPO) (iv) Chief Marketing and Sales Officer.
Under the theme of Employment, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) can
emphasise enhancing representation of on-roll and off-roll employees from the
AA Community.  Also, the social security aspects of contract workers. Under the
theme of Entrepreneurship (or supplier diversity), Chief of Procurement Officer
(CPO) can emphasise on increasing business volume and value in upstream supply
chain. Also, extending TAAP to supply chain partners. Chief Marketing and Sales
Officer (CM&SO) can emphasise on channel partner and customer focus on
downstream supply chain. Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) or CSR Officer can focus
on AA in community developmental interventions.

Aadhar – Deep commitment to inclusivity
Tata Motors adopted its ethos in letter and in spirit. Reaffirming its commitment
to inclusive growth, Tata Motors launched Aadhar – a structured framework
designed to uplift individuals from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST),
women, and persons with disabilities (PWD).
Affirmative Action addresses
social inequalities with a strategic
focus on five key areas: Education,
Employability, Essential Enablers,
are driven through CSR, while
business drives Employment
and Entrepreneurship.
In FY25, Tata Motors positively
impacted 1.4 million individuals from
underserved communities, with 56%
belonging to the SC/ST communities.
The Company CSR has committed
40% of its community engagement
resources to drive impact through
Affirmative Action initiatives.
The Integrated Village Development
Programme (IVDP), the flagship
AA programme of Tata Motors, has
emerged as a catalyst for holistic
transformation in rural communities,
leading to significant improvements
in overall well-being. Rooted in a
strategic vision, the program addresses
a broad range of developmental
challenges — spanning livelihood,
income generation, health, water
management, sanitation, and
governance — through strong
alignment with government schemes

and proactive engagement with local
stakeholders. Piloted in one tribal block
in the Palghar district of Maharashtra,
IVDP has now been replicated across
four states, including the tribal hamlets
around Sanand and Pune. In FY25,
around ~11 crore of convergence was
achieved via various Govt schemes,
around 20% increase in annual income
of villagers via various sustained
livelihood generation activities which
resulted in 30% reduction in migration
in search of alternate employment.

Employment initiatives

Tata Motors proactively supports
employment opportunities for youth
from SC/ST communities through tools
of positive discrimination.
Through initiatives like Kaushalya,
our employment-linked skilling
programme, we continue to enhance
employability and create sustainable
livelihoods for SC/ST, nomadic tribe
communities, and women. Under
Project Samavesh, Tata Motors began
onboarding transgender individuals
through service providers. In the first
phase, 17 transgender employees
joined across various functions,

strengthening our commitment to
workplace diversity. Similarly, cohort
of 141 specially-abled individuals were
on-boarded  at Pune, Jamshedpur,
Lucknow and Dharwad.

Promoting entrepreneurship

With an objective to encourage
entrepreneurship in AA communities,
the Company focusses on on-boarding
AA vendors in the value chain,
upskilling them to enhance their share
of business pie, and enabling creation
of jobs through indirect employment.
The Purchase and Supply Quality team
introduced a Positive Description
Policy and engaged with AA vendors
through various platforms which
led to enhancing business worth
I150 crore in FY25, against I75 crore
worth business that was awarded
in FY24.
Tata Motors affirmative action efforts
were recognised at the Tata Group
level and was awarded the highest
performing TAAP (Tata Affirmative
Action Programme) Jury Award for
FY25 by the Group Chairman.

The holistic engagement with rural communities under IVDP project has expanded from one gram panchayat in one district to four states

The Lakhpati Kisan

In India, agriculture continues to
remain a significant contributor to
employment, providing livelihoods
to its vast population. Majority of
India still lives in villages and their
farmlands sustain the country’s
billion plus population. Pick any
distressed rural farmer, and
one would see a common string
of woes – sole dependence on
monsoons, subsistence farming,
forced migration for employment
and waning interest of the youth
in agriculture. Chandrakant’s story
has been no different.
Chandrakant Sonya Andher, a Tribal
from Shiroshi village in Jawhar,
Maharashtra, is just a metric pass.
Traditionally, he cultivated Rabi
crops on the 2 acres of his 5-acre
landholding, while the remaining
land remained fallow mainly due
to the lack of sufficient water.

127

INTEGRATED
REPORT

Practicing rainfed agriculture, his
produce was limited to subsistence
needs, with no marketable surplus.
To support his family during the offseason, Chandrakant migrated to cities
like Nashik, Surat, and Thane for labour
work, though the income remained
minimal and insufficient for necessities.
Tata Motors CSR team through its
Integrated Village Development
Programme (IVDP) implemented
multiple interventions and innovative
techniques at his farm like fruit and
forestry plantations, fish farming,
nursery unit, farm Pond, bio-gas
unit, drip Irrigation, bamboo polyhouse, value Crops etc. Many of these
interventions were through leveraging
government schemes.
Chandrakant’s crop yields have
experienced substantial improvements,
resulting in increased profitability

and income doubled over the
years. This progress has had
a transformative impact on
Chandrakant’s standard of living,
enabling him to provide his children
with quality education and alleviate
financial constraints. Ability to
afford medical treatments during
emergencies, has further enhanced
the well-being of his family. The
positive transformation is also
evident in the housing situation,
as Chandrakant has been able to
construct an additional house on
his farm, reflecting the improved
living conditions resulting from his
farming success. The interventions
implemented by Chandrakant have
contributed to his earnings, with
this year’s turnover making him a
Lakhpati Kisan.

Supply chain and product
emissions scope 3

Our Scope 3 emissions are dominated
by in-use emissions. These are the
emissions generated from the use of
our vehicles. The electrification of our
fleet is, therefore, essential to achieve
our science-based targets and net zero
ambition. Central to this is our aim
for all brands to offer a pure-electric
option by 2030.
However, the achievement of these
ambitions is highly dependent on
consumer demand for battery electric
vehicles. We must also ensure that
we do not ‘burden shift’ by moving
emissions into our supply chain as
we make this transition. Therefore,
to decarbonise our supply chain and
product in-use emissions to net zero,
we must:
• Electrify our products to reduce
direct product emissions to zero
• Work with our value chain to
decarbonise the supply of key
materials and increased use of
recycled-content materials

Key initiatives

Our reduction in use of sold product
emissions totalled 1.29 tCO2e/vehicle
in the last financial year, driven
primarily by growth in plug-in hybrid
electric (PHEV) and battery electric
(BEV) as a proportion of total vehicles
retailed in FY25.
Our Procurement and Engineering
teams continued to collaborate with
suppliers to commit to the use of
recycled and low-impact materials, as
well as to enhance the accuracy of our
Scope 3 purchased goods reporting
in FY25, with particular focus on steel
and aluminium supply chains. This
process resulted in a total reduction of
0.62 tCO2e/vehicle from our Scope 3
purchased goods and services. These
improvements included lower product
carbon footprints (PCFs) reported by
suppliers, such as for windshields and
the contracting of recycled content in
sheet metal and components such as
axles and compressor housings.

Performance
Scope 1 and 2 emissions
In FY25, our absolute Scope 1 and
2 emissions marginally increased to
249.5 ktCO2e. This was a 1% increase
compared to our location-based
FY20 baseline but a 23.4% reduction
compared to our FY20 baseline. This
was also 3% ahead of the required
SBTi trajectory to be aligned to a
1.5°C pathway.
Scope 3
FY25 delivered continued improvement
in the impact of new vehicles during
their use, as well as collaboration with
our supply chain to reduce the impact
of the parts and components we use.
Our Scope 3 ‘use of sold products’
emissions for FY25 were 238.75 gCO2e
per vehicle km, representing a
reduction of 6.7% compared to our
FY20 baseline and a 3.1% improvement
compared to FY24.
Our Scope 3 ‘combined use of sold
products and purchased goods and
services’ emissions for FY25 were
60.51 tCO2e/vehicle. This was a
5.9% reduction compared to our
FY20 baseline and a 2.8% reduction
compared to our FY24 performance.
This means that in terms of absolute
emissions, our Scope 3 emissions
across these categories totalled
25.9 MtCO2e — a 20.7% reduction
compared to the FY20 baseline and
a 3.4% improvement over FY24. This
improvement was driven by lower
emissions and reduced production
volumes lower per vehicle emissions
relative to the baseline year.

Circular enablers

Our Circularity Lab aims to reduce waste and boost the recyclability of our
products. The lab fosters internal collaboration, bringing together cross-disciplinary
squads comprising Sustainability, Engineering, Procurement and Design, with
external engagement with value chain partners and learning from institutions such
as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
The squads disassemble and analyse vehicles, components and materials in a
collaborative ‘learn through doing’ approach, working closely with suppliers and
experts in materials to understand and overcome barriers to reuse and recycling.

Circular products and services

Circular resources

Our Circularity Lab has led initiatives to at least double and an aim to treble
recycled content in new products from 2028 and has focused on opportunities
for closed-loop recycling. This has led to a significant technical breakthrough in
the closed-loop recycling of polyurethane seat foam by successfully reintegrating
it back into the production of new seats. Polyurethane foams are known to be
challenging when it comes to recycling and are designed for durability, meaning
they end up in landfill. In collaboration with Dow’s MobilityScience™, material
innovations and global leader in automotive seating Adient, this is the first
time closed-loop seat foam content has been successfully used in automotive
production. We are now putting the material through its full production process,
aiming to test its use at scale in preproduction vehicles in 2025. The recycled foam
will be one element of a new ‘circular seat’ that is estimated to halve the impact of
CO2e emissions while maintaining high performance.
In FY25 our water withdrawal marginally increased to 16,22,957 cubic metres for
our in-scope sites from 16,16,821 cubic metrics in the previous financial year. This
is an increase of 0.18m3/vehicle to 4.05m3/vehicle representing a 4.7% increase
in water withdrawal per vehicle produced compared to FY24. Projects have
targeted reducing water use in processes with high water withdrawal such as the
introduction of a smart spray process in the Solihull, UK paint shop.
The introduction of our target to achieve zero waste to landfill and increase
non‑metallic waste sent for recycling / reuse has also led to a greater focus on
waste segregation at our sites, such as bin tip audits and collaboration with
suppliers to increase reuse of parts protection at Solihull, UK. In FY25, our waste
generation reduced by 1,919 metric tonnes to 35,118 metric tonnes for our
in‑scope sites. An average reduction in waste of 1.05kg/vehicle was achieved in the
last financial year compared to FY24.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

The transition from a linear business
model to a more sustainable, circular
mobility model is essential for the
automotive industry to reduce
resource consumption per kilometre
travelled. Services such as ‘Pivotal’,
which provides clients with an allinclusive, fully flexible subscription
service, and ‘THE OUT’, a luxury car
rental service, are the first steps
towards these new mobility models.
InMotion Ventures Studio continues
to incubate these services and
explore new opportunities in the
circularity sphere.
However, these services require
infrastructure, design and engineering
changes to make them more circular.
To support this, we have begun trials
on the in-life refurbishment of the
Pivotal fleet as well as the longer-term
processing of end-of-life vehicles for
refurbishment of green parts.
We are also making progress on the
engineering of components to ensure
they can be reused and recovered
during and after use.
Historically, vehicles have been
designed with limited consideration
for disassembly once they reach endof-life. The use of difficult to separate
mixed materials, fixing methods and
adhesives can make the challenge of
reducing waste and recycling for reuse
almost impossible. The Circularity
Lab is now feeding this information
directly into early decision-making for
vehicle development.

Responsible
business

The responsible business
pillar is a cornerstone of
our sustainability strategy,
aiming to ensure we
conduct business ethically
and with integrity. Being
a responsible business
provides the foundations
for our work in Planet
Regenerate and Engage
for Good when it comes to
environmental, social and
governance (ESG) topics.

Focus areas
1

Monitoring and responding to
ESG legislation and regulation

2

Developing the right strategies and governance
processes to deliver our ESG commitments

3

Embedding environmental and social risks into our
enterprise risk management process

4

Transparently disclosing and
reporting our progress and performance
Legislation and regulation

The landscape of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulation is rapidly
changing. We are working to ensure our disclosures align with relevant Climate
Financial Disclosures while also preparing for upcoming legislation such as the
EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the EU Deforestation
Regulation (EUDR). This involves scanning for new and emerging legislation,
interpreting and implementing necessary changes into the business and then
monitoring and disclosing progress on an ongoing basis.

Strategy and governance

Our stakeholders have high expectations regarding our sustainability efforts.
This year the value of sustainability was recognised at the highest level within
the business with the appointment of Andrea Debbane to the position of Chief
Sustainability Officer (CSO). We have also established a senior-level, crossfunctional Sustainability Steering Group to ensure the work we are doing in relation
to sustainability supports and complements our Reimagine strategy.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

Risk management

Managing our environmental
and social risks is integrated into
the Company’s enterprise risk
management process. We collaborate
with multiple stakeholders across the
organisation to identify and address
the most significant environmental
and social risks to our business, with
appropriate escalation to the Risk and
Compliance Committee.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is becoming an ever-challenging topic
globally; however, we believe that we must reflect the diversity of the
world in which our colleagues and clients live. We are committed to our
cultural transformation to create a positive, inclusive environment where
everyone feels respected, valued and cared for.
To do this, we are taking action to make tangible impact, measured
against three internal ambitions:
Target 1:
Globally, 30% of all senior leaders to be female, by 2030.
FY25 performance: 21%

Disclosure and reporting

Much of the emerging sustainability
legislation requires greater levels
of transparency and disclosure
on business impacts, risks and
opportunities in relation to
environmental, social and governance
(ESG) topics. This greater transparency
is crucial to meet the needs and
expectations of our stakeholders.

Target 2:
In the UK, 15% of all senior leaders to be from Black, Asian or Mixed
Ethnicity background, by 2030.
FY25 performance: 7%
Target 3:
Globally, for our Inclusion Index to reach over 85, by 2026.
FY25 performance: 83

The target date to achieve ambitions 1 and 2 has been extended from 2026 to 2030.
We recognise that we have more work to do and are allowing time to make further
adjustments and for organic growth.

DEI achievements

Our global Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion (DEI) policy details our
continued commitment to creating a
safe, diverse, equitable and inclusive
workplace. Since 2022, our Global DEI
team has been working on our Global
Digital Learning Experience in response
to the DEI basics learning originally
launched in the UK. The objective
of this project was to develop a DEI
learning that resonates with people
across our global locations. In 2024,
the Global Digital Learning Experience
launched across 24 countries and
regions, educating on cultural nuances
while navigating local laws and cultural
complexity, which are all at different
stages of the DEI journey.
In September 2024, we hosted our
second Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Summit, welcoming a combined
number of over 6,300 participants
in person and online, spanning 25
countries and 22 watch parties. This
event celebrates the progress we
make year-on-year and continues to
cement our ambition to ensure that all
colleagues are supported. The theme
for this event was ‘Inclusion For All’.
In 2024, we also held our first
International Women’s and
Automotive Collective with three of
our semiconductor suppliers to begin
creating an inclusive environment
throughout our entire ecosystem.

Human capital development
Talent upskilling for the future

We have continued to build on our previous activities with growing investment
in electrification safety training pathways for over 1,000 learners to support
a range of roles across our business, initially prioritising those in our development
workshops, as well as continuing to support our manufacturing colleagues.
Our Level 4 Data Fellowship Apprenticeship pathway for established colleagues
seeking to grow their skills has seen the first cohorts complete, with 55% achieving
distinction, significantly above the national average.
We have restructured our Six Sigma yellow and green belt programmes to
support a range of business functions with structured problem solving and seen
documented outcomes from the integrated projects colleagues have undertaken to
complete their awards.
Additionally, we have built and piloted a new programme for our Executive Leader
population in Data Leadership skills, combining internal subject matter expert
experience with the support of a leading academic business school and engineering
department. This has been adapted to integrate better with our Modern Leadership
approach, with opportunities to dive deeper for those who require specific
technical capability.

Early careers
Early Careers and investment in apprentices, undergraduates and graduates
continue to form a key foundation for our talent pool and are a critical enabler of
building skills for the future. In 2024, nearly 900 people joined us in the UK on our
Early Careers programmes, and approximately 300 internationally.
Our programmes have received external recognition, with JLR climbing from
59th to 42nd in the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers in the UK.

Safety

Our core ambition is to achieve a
workplace where Zero Harm can be
realised and maintained. We continue
to focus on our three safety pillars
of Safe Place, Safe Systems and Safe
People, which provide the framework
for our approach to continual
improvement on our glidepath to
Zero Harm.

Our Safety Management System is continually refined to provide an effective
framework for safety organisation, and our commitment to maintaining the highest
standards of occupational health, safety and wellbeing for our colleagues, partners
and clients is reflected in our ongoing certification to ISO 45001 .

Zero Harm
OUR SAFET Y JOURNEY

We continue to focus on our internal
auditing activity and data aggregation
and analysis capabilities to understand
where there are opportunities for
further improvement. Our programme
of safety process automation
contributes to us meeting the
requirements set out in our Safety
Management System, allowing
us to monitor and analyse data in
real-time, quickly identifying and
addressing potential issues and further
contributing to our culture of safety
and continuous improvement.

Sustainable supply chain
At the core of our sustainability journey
is a dream that is bigger than just
automobiles — it is the dream of leaving
behind a greener, healthier planet for
future generations. With ambitious goals
to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040
for Passenger Vehicles (PV) and 2045 for
Commercial Vehicles (CV), we understand
that no dream can be fulfilled alone.
Sustainability is a shared responsibility,
and the Company has committed to
empowering its vast network of suppliers
to embrace sustainable practices. It’s
not just a supply chain anymore — it’s
a partnership of purpose, built on a
foundation of trust, respect, and unity.

Tata Motor’s sustainable supply
chain framework

Tata Motor’s Sustainable Supply Chain
Framework reflects our aspiration
to weave sustainability into the very
fabric of our supply chain. It’s a step
towards responsible growth that inspires
partners, stakeholders, and industries
to walk together on the path of progress
with purpose. The implementation and
oversight of supply chain sustainability
programmes are overseen by the
Executive Management, who report
regularly to the Board of Directors on
performance and strategic direction.
Our Supply Chain Sustainability
framework is built on four key pillars:

I

Ambition

A clear vision for sustainability –
The foundation of this framework lies
in Ambition — a clear and resolute
vision that aligns Tata Motors’ supply
chain goals with its larger sustainability
mission. It establishes precise KPIs and
targets, setting the stage for meaningful
and measurable progress. This ambition
isn’t just an internal pursuit — it calls on
suppliers and partners to align with the
same vision, fostering collective growth.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

II

Policies: Governance with
integrity and purpose

Every movement needs a guiding
compass, and Tata Motors achieves
this through comprehensive policies.
From an enhanced Supplier Code
of Conduct to robust procurement
policies, these principles ensure
that every action aligns with high
ethical and environmental standards.
The purchasing practices are reviewed
to ensure alignment to the SCoC
and to avoid potential conflicts. This
governance framework not only
mitigates risks but also creates a culture
of trust and integrity, aiming to set
a gold standard for the industry.

III

Process: Building resilience
with robust processes:

The sustainable supply chain framework
integrates Sustainability at all stages
of the supplier life cycle. Starting from
the Request for Quotation (RFQ) and
Manufacturing Site Assessments to
an exhaustive desk-based annual ESG
Supplier Assessment Questionnaire
(SAQ) for existing suppliers, helping
Tata Motors identify those leading
the way and offering corrective and
improvement plans to those who need
to improve. By carefully evaluating
supplier partners at every step,
Tata Motors will ensure only those who
share its commitment to sustainability
become a long-term partner of
its ecosystem. Risk Management
Frameworks are also being incorporated
to proactively identify and mitigate
risks, ensuring seamless governance and
continuous improvement.

IV

Enablers: Aikyam: ‘A dream
fuelled by vision and unity’

At the heart of Tata Motors’ Supply
Chain Sustainability strategy is it
Aikyam, a Sanskrit word that means
‘unity’. This isn’t just a platform — it’s
a movement that binds suppliers,
employees, and stakeholders under
a single vision: creating a sustainable
future, together. Aikyam serves as
the bridge between ambition and
action, fostering collaboration through
workshops, knowledge-sharing sessions,
collective learning and high impact
projects. At the core of ‘AIKYAM’
are our ‘Apex Chapters’, strategically
positioned to prioritise and spearhead
flagship projects aimed at pioneering
sustainability solutions within our
industry. Within each ‘Apex Chapter’,
our ‘Affiliate Chapters’ delve deep
into specific sustainability hotspots,
taking targeted actions to address key
challenges. The supplier screening
exercise basis business relevance on
the commodity specific risks, helps us
identify the significant suppliers who are
integrated as part of this forum.

Through these refined processes,
Tata Motors emphasises that
sustainability is not an afterthought
— it is embedded into every decision,
creating a supply chain that is resilient,
agile, and future‑ready.

144

Small steps, big impact:

To turn dreams into reality, Tata Motors has embarked on four transformative
lighthouse projects:
1.

101 RE 100 – A commitment to adoption of renewable electricity in supply chain

2.

D.R.O.P. – Dependency Reduction & Optimisation Programme – Ensuring
responsible water usage

3. 	Zero Waste to Landfill – Reducing environmental impact
4.

Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘SEBI Listing Regulations’),

during the second quarter. Demand remained measured in
the lead-up to state and general elections, contributing to a
moderation in overall volumes.
The bus segment, however continued to perform steadily,
supported by sustained government investments in public
transportation and the gradual shift toward electric mobility.
SCVs and pickups faced challenges arising from muted rural
demand and tighter credit availability, which impacted
retail momentum. Electric commercial vehicles witnessed
growing interest, particularly in the bus and last-mile delivery
segments, aided by the progression of public tenders and
improving Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) economics.
At the broader industry level, infrastructure investments and
increased adoption of digital tools supported operational
efficiencies and influenced fleet replacement decisions.
The continued transition toward cleaner mobility, including
electric, Compressed Natural Gas (‘CNG’) and alternative fuel
vehicles, remained a key consideration in Original Equipment
Manufacturer (‘OEM’) strategies.

India in the Management Discussion & Analysis section of the

Board’s Report
(i)

demerger of the Company’s Commercial Vehicles
Business from TML to TMLCV, and

(ii)

merger of TMPV undertaking the Passenger Vehicles
Business with TML (“Scheme”).

The effectiveness of the Scheme would result in creation of
two separate listed companies with mirror shareholding with
the Resulting Company housing the Commercial Vehicles
Business and the Amalgamated Company housing the
Passenger Vehicles Business. Upon the effectiveness of the
Scheme, the Amalgamated Company carrying on Passenger
Vehicles Business will be renamed as “Tata Motors Passenger
Vehicles Limited” and the Resulting Company, carrying
on the Commercial Vehicles Business, will be renamed as
“Tata Motors Limited”.
The proposed Scheme would be in the best interests of
the Amalgamated Company, the Resulting Company, the
Amalgamating Company and their respective shareholders,
employees, creditors and other stakeholders for the
below reasons:
i.

The distinctive profile and established business model of
the Commercial Vehicles Business and Passenger Vehicles
Business makes it suitable to be housed in separately
listed entities, allowing sharper strategic focus in pursuit
of their independent value creation trajectories;

ii.

The Scheme would result in better and efficient control
and management for the Commercial Vehicles Business
and the Passenger Vehicles Business and would further
empower the respective businesses to pursue their
respective strategies to deliver growth with greater
agility while reinforcing accountability;

iii.

The Scheme would unlock value for the overallbusiness portfolio through price-discovery of the
Amalgamated Company and the Resulting Company for
existing shareholders and shall entail direct holding of
marketable securities therein;

iv.

The Scheme could lead to the right operating
architecture for both companies with sharper focus
on their individual business strategies and clear capital
allocation, in alignment with their respective value
creation journeys; and

v.

Separately listed companies will attract specific set of
investors for their business profile and consequently,
encourage focused capital market outcomes.

The Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated March 25, 2025,
directed the Company (i) to convene and hold the meeting
of the equity shareholders of the Company; (ii) dispensed
the convening and holding of the meeting of the secured
creditors; and (iii) dispensed convening and holding of the
meeting of the unsecured creditors (including debenture
holders) (‘unsecured creditors’).

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

The Company in compliance with the directions of the Hon’ble
NCLT convened meetings of the Equity Shareholders on
May 6, 2025 to seek shareholders’ approval on the Scheme.
The Scheme was approved by requisite majority.

DEBENTURES

on private placement basis, rated, listed, unsecured and
redeemable Non-Convertible Debentures aggregating
₹2,000 crore.
Refer para on “Details of Non-Convertible Debentures” of the
Corporate Governance (‘CG’) Report for additional details.

FINANCE & CREDIT RATING
During FY25, by continuing strong free cash flow generation,
the Tata Motors Group (‘the Group’) delivered on its
deleveraging targets and became net cash positive. The Net
Auto cash of Tata Motors Group stood at ₹1,018 crore at the
end of FY25 as compared to net auto debt of ₹16,022 crore at
the end of FY24. The Group continues to maintain sufficient
liquidity at all times to navigate the impact of external
challenges. As at March 31, 2025, the Group liquidity for
domestic operations was ₹15,991 crore, whereas the liquidity

growth, improvement in consolidated business and financial
risk profiles, strong Free Cash Flow (‘FCF’) generation
and deleveraging.
S&P upgraded Tata Motors by two notches to investment
grade rating at BBB/Stable. Moody’s upgraded the rating of
the Company by two notches to Ba1 / Positive. CRISIL and
ICRA upgraded the long term rating by one notch to AA+/
Stable. CARE Ratings also maintained long term rating at AA+/
Stable during the year. Even post demerger, rating agencies
expect both the resultant companies to continue to maintain
strong credit profile and demerger does not impact financial
risk profile.
S&P Global Ratings upgraded Jaguar Land Rover Automotive
Plc’s (JLR) long term issuer credit rating to ‘BBB-’ from ‘BB’,
JLR’s first investment grade rating. Also, Moody’s upgraded
JLR’s long term issuer credit rating to ‘Ba2’ from ‘Ba3’.

SAFETY & HEALTH – PERFORMANCE &
INITIATIVES
SAFETY
Safety is not merely a compliance protocol, but a core
organizational value and an unwavering commitment
that underpins the Company’s operations. Guided by ISO
45001:2018-aligned Integrated Safety Management System,
the Company cultivated a robust Zero Harm Culture that
protects lives, promotes well-being and prepares for mobility.
Occupational Safety is governed through a comprehensive,
multi-tiered structure led by the Safety, Health & Sustainability
(‘SHS’) Board & SHS Committee, supported by SHS Councils,
Corporate Sub-Committees and Plant Apex Committees.
This seamless strategic-to-operational integration ensures
effective safety management.
In FY25, the Company’s safety agenda was anchored through
four strategic focus areas:
•

Leadership Behavior & Governance for a Zero Harm
Culture: the Company reinforced its Safety Culture

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

•

Business Partner Safety Management: the Company’s
Business Partner Safety Program, built on six key levers
and risk-based categorization, has been deployed across
all vendor categories. the Company completed Star
Rating assessments for 370 partners and instituted 169
Self-Managed Teams (SMTs) across plants, with a clear
roadmap for capability progression. Additionally, the
Company has established specially curated programs on
driver dignity and conservancy staff amenities as part of
the Company’s dignity and inclusion efforts.

•

Digital & AI for Safety: Five themes guide the Company’s
digital safety transformation - Connected Workforce,
Video Analytics, Connected Assets, Safety Management
Systems, and Experiential Learning. The Company has
developed 23 AI models to drive predictive safety, while
deploying 1,137 controls across all plants.

•

Reward & Recognition Culture: A structured recognition
framework celebrates safety champions across the
Company and Business Partners through Spot Awards,
Best SMT recognitions, Safety Point Leaders and Safety
Stewards. Plant-level Safety Competitions and quarterly
Business Partner Reward Programs further incentivize
proactive safety practices.

These concerted efforts have delivered tangible results.
In FY25, the Company achieved a 25.7% reduction in Total
Recordable Case Frequency Rate (TRCFR) (from 0.74 to 0.55)
and a 37.5% improvement in Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate
(LTIFR) (from 0.24 to 0.15). Total Recordable Cases (TRC) cases
dropped by 29% compared to the previous year.
However, despite our vigilant approach, the Company deeply
regret one fatal incident during the year. A comprehensive
investigation was carried out followed by systemic
corrective actions, which are now institutionalized across
the organization.
Looking ahead, the Company remains steadfast in the
commitment to embedding safety into every process and
decision—leveraging digital intelligence, fostering inclusive
partnerships with the business partners and building a
resilient, Zero Harm workplace driven through the Company’s
Safety culture model and eight leadership behaviors.

We respect differences that are fundamental to an individual’s identity, such as age, gender, ethnicity, race,
physical ability, mental ability, and sexual orientation, as well as latent and invisible differences that shape
our perspectives, like education, work experience, parental status, etc. We are committed to being an equal
opportunity employer, maintaining dignity and respect for all.

			

Tata Motors defines DEI as establishing an environment where diversity is embraced as a natural and integral
part of the organisation. We believe—and have witnessed—that a gender-balanced workforce leads to increased
productivity, better decisions, enhanced collaboration, and more innovative ideas. We are gradually focusing on
moving beyond gender and have received well-accepted dipstick research to support this as well.

			

In order to mobilize DEI in our DNA, we have framed the 10-point Lighthouse approach to build a standardized,
mature model of DEI that helps us stay abreast of the latest societal developments and simultaneously
implement the same in the organization. These include enhancing gender diversity in the workforce along with
representation at the leadership level, with the goal of having 10% women in senior management by 2026. Tata
Motors has also taken landmark steps to increase the representation of the LGBTQ+ community in its workforce
through various hiring pilot initiatives. Adhering to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, Tata Motors
also has hiring pilots for the differently abled, along with making the working environment conducive for them to
function well through steps like infrastructure readiness. Apart from these, sensitization of the overall workforce
to enable a friendly working atmosphere for all was achieved through training sessions with 84% coverage last
year and an intention to raise this number in the following years.

			

We are working towards creating an inclusive workplace culture through our policies and processes. The company
organizes sensitisation and awareness campaigns to help create an open mind and culture to leverage diversity
at the workplace.

			

Tata Motors also keeps enhancing its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity principles in the workforce through
processes like ISO DEI Audits, Culture Surveys, etc., thereby making its initiatives more holistic in contributing
better towards the empowerment of vulnerable sections of society and thus towards building a better future
for all.

26. Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
		

Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:

		

At Tata Motors, we acknowledge the role of materiality assessments in ensuring that our ESG efforts are relevant,
strategic, and impactful. This year marks a significant milestone for TML as we have broadened our approach to
materiality assessments by incorporating the concept of double materiality for the first time.

		

The Double Materiality Assessment (‘DMA’) has helped us determine which sustainability issues are most important
to both the organization and its stakeholders. It involves evaluating the impact of the organization on environmental
and social factors (inside-out perspective) and examining how these factors affect the organization (outsidein perspective). This dual approach helps the company identify and prioritize ESG issues that are both financially
important and socially impactful, promoting the comprehensive integration of sustainability into its core strategy.

Own Operations:
Energy use in
manufacturing contributes
to Scope 1 and Scope 2
greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Transitioning
to renewable energy
presents a strategic
opportunity to mitigate
emissions, and enhance
long-term cost efficiency.
In alignment with our
RE100 commitment, this
opportunity supports our
decarbonization roadmap
while strengthening
business resilience and
aligning with global
expectations on climate
action and sustainable
growth.

In case of risk, approach to
adapt or mitigate
Tata Motors is cognizant of
the physical and transition
risks posed by climate
change in the short, medium
and long term. We have set
ourselves ambitious targets
of achieving Net Zero GHG
emissions by 2045 in CV
business, and 2040 in the
PV business. We have set
intermediate targets of
achieving RE100 before the
end of this decade and are
committed to set interim
Science Based Targets.
Our roadmap, at the
operations level, and
product level, are fully
aligned to our ambition and
our intermediate targets.

Suppliers may need to
shift to renewable energy
sources to lower emissions,
which could affect their
operational expenses.
Variations in energy costs,
particularly for renewable
sources, can influence
supplier pricing and the
overall cost framework.
Collaborating with suppliers
to support them in
transitioning to renewable
energy presents a significant
opportunity for TML.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Positive Implications:
This opportunity is
anticipated to positively
impact TML’s finances,
driven by potential market
prospects for low-emission
vehicles.
Although investing in
renewable energy projects
requires substantial initial
funding, the long-term
financial gains and strategic
benefits can surpass these
costs, bolstering TML’s
financial stability and
sustainability objectives.
Negative Implications:
Regulatory noncompliance related to
emission standards can
have significant legal,
financial, and reputational
consequences for
companies.

Downstream (Long term):
Emissions from internal
combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles play a major role in
contributing to greenhouse
gases and climate change.
TML adheres to CAFÉ
regulations. Transitioning
to low-emission vehicles
offers TML growth
potential and supports
its climate mitigation
initiatives.
2.

Financial implications of
the risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or
negative implications)
Positive implications:

Own Operations (Long
term):

This opportunity is expected
to positively impact TML’s
finances as a result of new
revenue opportunities.

The increasing regulations
on resource use and waste
management can have
significant implications
for TML. Streamlining
manufacturing processes
presents an opportunity
for TML to reduce resource
outflows and waste.
High demand can lead to
fluctuating raw material
prices, causing financial
uncertainty and increased
costs, which in turn can
affect profit margins.
Environmental impacts
of resource use might
prompt stricter government
regulations on consumption.
By adopting circular
economy principles, like
recycling and reusing
materials in manufacturing,
TML can reduce resource
use and waste.

This opportunity is
projected to positively
impact TML’s finances.
It can create additional
revenue streams by
selling byproducts or
recycled materials to other
industries. TML can also
reduce the costs associated
with raw material
procurement. Utilizing
recycled materials often
costs less than purchasing
new ones, leading to
direct savings.

-

Circular sourcing result in
streamlined operations
and lower production
costs, enhancing overall
profitability. Using recycled
materials typically incurs
lower expenses.

Downstream (Medium
term): Vehicles are
composed of various
valuable materials. Failure
to properly recycle these
materials means they are
lost to landfills instead of
being recovered. Circular
business models are
designed to minimize waste
and maximize resource
efficiency by keeping
products, materials, and
resources in use for as long
as possible.

Upstream (Long term):
Rising demand for finite
resources can lead to
scarcity and heightened
competition, disrupting
supply chains. By exploring
the opportunity of
adopting sustainable
sourcing strategies,
TML can minimize
environmental impacts
and maintain supply chain
stability. Additionally,
developing robust vehicle
recycling and refurbishing
services can enhance
sustainability and reduce
dependence on virgin
materials.

and ecosystem risks
stem from raw material
sourcing linked to
deforestation, habitat loss,
and land degradation.
These impacts may pose
regulatory, reputational,
and operational risks,
emphasizing the need for
sustainable sourcing and
supplier due diligence.

80th Integrated Annual Report

(Indicate positive or

Upstream (Medium term):
Relying on suppliers that
require large volumes of
water for their operations
makes TML vulnerable to
disruptions, especially if
those suppliers are located
in regions prone to water
scarcity or drought.
8

Own Workforce Labour practices

Opportunity

Own Operations (Medium
term): Inadequate wages
and gender pay inequity
can decrease employee
satisfaction, increase
turnover, reduce diversity
and may lead to labor
disputes. Implementing
proactive labor practices
can attract potential
employees, boost morale,
and enhance innovation
and productivity.

-

Positive Implications:
This opportunity is
projected to positively
impact TML’s financials
by boosting productivity
through improved labor
practices.

9

Own Workforce
- Training and
development

Opportunity

Own Operations (Medium
term): Neglecting
investment in skills
development could lead to
a workforce unable to keep
pace with technological
progress. Cultivating a
skilled and diverse team
can spur innovation,
enabling the Company to
produce state-of-the-art
products and sustain its
competitive advantage.

TML is actively
implementing upskilling
initiatives, including the
creation of an MTech
curriculum centered
on ESG and AI. The
Company also provides a
3-year diploma program
through ITI as part of
its commitment to skill
enhancement. Moreover,
TML has introduced
innovative programs to
retain and nurture talent,
such as a 5-year PhD
program.

Positive Implications:
This opportunity is
anticipated to positively
influence TML’s revenue
through investments
in employee training,
leading to enhanced
quality, innovation, and
production.

Our Workforce
– Health and
safety

Risk

Own Operations (Medium
term): Failure to comply
with evolving health and
safety regulations can
result in fines, sanctions,
and legal actions. These
penalties can be costly and
can impact a company’s
financial health.

TML complies with all
safety regulations. TML
prioritizes comprehensive
health and safety
measures, including
workplace safety training
and occupational
safety. The Company
also highlights accident
investigation, to maintain a
safe work environment.

Negative Implications:
This risk may have a
negative effect which
includes fines, penalties
and in severe cases
imprisonment and
temporary shutting down
of operations.

Downstream (Medium
Term): There is an
opportunity to go beyond
regulations and attract
customers who value the
safety features offered by
TML’s products.

-

Positive Implications:
TML is recognized by
consumers for the
superior safety ratings of
its vehicles. There is an
opportunity to build on its
brand perception and offer
enhanced safety features
to consumers, improving
market share.

12

Business
Conduct

Risk

Own Operations (Long
term): If whistle-blower
concerns are not properly
addressed, TML may
face regulatory, legal,
and reputational risks,
potentially resulting in
scandals. Legal penalties
can be incurred in
situations involving
corruption, bribery, insider
trading, and other ethical
violations.

TML has established
systems and processes,
such as audits and due
diligence, to ensure
compliance. The Company
also conducts regular
training sessions for its
employees on topics
related to bribery,
corruption, and other
ethical issues.

Negative Implications: This
risk could adversely affect
TML, as non-compliance
might result in fines, and in
severe cases, prosecution
and temporary suspension
of operations.

Downstream (Long term):
Unethical practices within
dealership and service
networks can expose TML
to significant regulatory
and legal risks, which can
have serious repercussions
on its operations and
reputation. This can lead
to consumer backlash
and a shift in customer
preferences away from
TML.

TML provides training
for dealers via online
modules upon their
joining. Additionally, audits
and unannounced visits
are conducted to ensure
compliance.

Own Operations
(Medium term): ESG
issues in investments
can pose significant
financial risks. Failing to
consider ESG factors in
investment decisions can
damage a Company’s
reputation. In today’s
market, stakeholders
are increasingly valuing
sustainability, and
negative perceptions can
lead to reduced brand
loyalty and decreased
competitiveness.

TML provides transparent
reports on its ESG
initiatives and performance
to build trust with
stakeholders and showcase
its commitment and
accountability.

Reputation damage and

enhanced reputation and
investor attractiveness. On
the other hand, investment
in non-aligned ESG areas
can lead to reputational
damage and reduced brand
loyalty.

Integration of responsible
investment practices
enhances the organization’s
reputation and can attract

Financial implications of

(Indicate positive or

Upstream (Medium term):
Human Rights-related
issues in any tier of the
supply chain can pose
reputation and regulatory
risks for TML and its
suppliers. If Human rights
concerns are not properly
addressed, suppliers may
face regulatory, legal,
and reputational risks,
potentially affecting their
operations and in turn,
business continuity at TML.

TML periodically seeks
Human rights-related
information from suppliers.
The company encourages
suppliers to create
mechanisms for affected
individuals to report
human rights violations
and create systems to
detect and resolve the
issues in a time-bound
manner.

Negative implications:
This risk is anticipated to
negatively impact TML.
Suppliers’ failure to ensure
human rights for their
employees and workers
will negatively impact on
TML’s reputation, and in
extreme cases, limit the
suppliers’ ability to provide
services to TML, affecting
business continuity.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? If Yes, what percentage of inputs were
sourced sustainably?
Tata Motors is driving a transformative shift to establish itself as a leader in Sustainable Mobility. Understanding the crucial
role of the supply chain in this transition, TML introduced the ‘Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative’ in 2017, followed by the
launch of ‘AIKYAM,’ a collaborative platform, in 2023.
As part of this initiative, we have developed a comprehensive framework that includes a Supplier Code of Conduct, an
Environmental Procurement Policy, and Sustainability Guidelines for Suppliers. These guidelines cover key areas such as
governance, legal compliance, management system certification, transparency and reporting, occupational health and
safety, labor rights, and human rights. By setting these standards, we aim to foster responsible business practices among
our suppliers and partners. We have also updated our Manufacturing Site Audit questionnaire to include a sustainability
pillar, which ensures that any new supplier is scrutinized on sustainability as well.
To ensure effective implementation, we have established strong oversight mechanisms for our supplier ESG program. The
highest decision-making body, the Executive Committee Members, along with the Chief Purchasing Officer, is responsible
for monitoring and guiding this critical aspect of our sustainability strategy.
Additionally, our procurement processes are continuously reviewed to align with the Supplier Code of Conduct and prevent
any potential conflicts with our ESG commitments. This ongoing evaluation ensures that every stage of our procurement
strategy remains in sync with our sustainability goals.
We also conduct thorough assessments of our suppliers to measure their compliance with ESG standards, providing
valuable insights into their environmental and social performance. Recognizing the importance of internal stakeholders,
we provide extensive training to our procurement teams and relevant personnel. Expanding this initiative further, we
introduced the Dealer Sustainability Handbook in 2025 to help dealerships enhance their sustainability practices. These
guidelines, along with ESG performance assessments, ensure alignment with our broader sustainability vision.
TML Suppliers Covering 68% of Annual Purchase Value ( APV ) have either ISO 45001 or ISO 14001 Certifiation.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) Other waste.
As part of end-of-life product management, we are continuously working on improving our product’s circularity. This
involves designing the vehicle for recyclability, selecting sustainable materials by studying their environmental impact,
designing vehicle assemblies/components that are easy to dismantle, and providing information about the same in our
products, etc.
The design-for-recycling approach complements our initiative on the circular economy, which aims to minimize waste and
reduce negative impact. During the design stage, TML has been encouraging the use of recyclable materials in products
and is actively working towards improving product recyclability. Typically, all vehicles are designed to achieve a minimum
of 90% recyclability and recoverability. As a responsible organization committed to sustainability and the environment,
we are publishing dismantling information on a portal named IDIS (i.e., International Dismantling Information System).
Dismantlers can access this information for the efficient recycling of non-metallic automobile parts like bumpers, trim
parts, dashboards, etc.
As part of the product design stage, we are currently working on exploratory projects to further use more biodegradable
materials, recycled materials, and re-refined base oil (RRBO) to enhance product circularity. At the end of the product
lifecycle, scrapping and recycling vehicles in a responsible way supports environmental goals. Tata Motors demonstrated

its holistic commitment to sustainable mobility with the launch of “Re.Wi.Re – Recycle with Respect” to facilitate the safe
recycling of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs).
The state-of-the-art Tata Motors Re.Wi.Re. facility is designed to dismantle end-of-life passenger and commercial vehicles
of all brands. These facilities will drive responsible scrapping and recycling of ELVs by using globally benchmarked and
optimized processes. With the launch of Re.Wi.Re., Tata Motors aims to offer better value capture in downstream
businesses, generate employment, and support the minimization of environmental pollution caused by aged vehicles. Tata
Motors has opened five more Re.Wi.Re. facilities under a franchise-based model, taking the total to seven facilities with an
annual capacity to dismantle more than 1,10,000 vehicles.
We are committed to expanding Re.Wi.Re. facilities across the country to promote circularity and enhance and organize
our value chain play. This move will lessen the pollution involved in the dismantling of ELVs and bring this activity within the
organized sector.
Operations:
Our manufacturing operations generate various types of wastes which are covered under various national regulations. All
our plants ensure that the management of such wastes is done in full compliance with these legal requirements as specified
by the operating permits, consents, and authorizations.
Our manufacturing operations receive a large and diverse number of parts, components, and consumables in various
forms of packaging which are discarded. These are segregated as per material type and shape and sold to recyclers for
conversion and utilization. Specifically, we ensure the sale of all flexible and rigid plastic packaging to authorized plastic
waste processors for recycling and utilization in the manufacture of new packaging material. Hazardous and other wastes
are similarly routed to authorized recyclers or re-processors for material recovery, or to co-processing for energy recovery
through cement plants. We also ensure the safe disposal of specific hazardous wastes, as mandated in operating consent/
authorizations, through government-authorized Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities.
E-wastes from our operations, comprising electronic devices, their components, and IT assets that are discarded after their
useful life or due to obsolescence, are disposed of only through authorized recyclers.
Where technically feasible, we are utilizing recovered materials such as reclaimed thinner, secondary paint made from
paint sludge, or sand from our foundries in our own manufacturing operations or in our supply chain.

not, provide steps taken to address the same.
Yes, the EPR provisions under the Plastic Waste Management & Handling Rules, 2016 (as amended) are applicable to the
Company. Tata Motors Limited (‘TML’) (Commercial Vehicle business) is registered as a “Brand Owner” and as an “Importer”
with the CPCB and have complied with the requirements of the Registration for the concluded year 2024-25. The Company
have set up internal systems to track and ensure compliance on a running basis for FY25 and beyond.
Legal compliance of our EPR target for FY 2024-25 has been ensured by the procurement of re-cycling certificates through
a third party. Going forward, we will continue to fulfil our EPR targets through this route using the established systems for
collection, transportation, and the re-cycling of post-consumer plastic packaging waste. TML is registered as a “Producer”
under the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, with the CPCB and is working towards fulfilling necessary requirements.
Additionally, the Company has also applied for registration under the EPR framework for used oil management and is taking

Accessibility of workplaces: Are the premises / offices of the entity accessible to differently abled employees and
workers, as per the requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps are
being taken by the entity in this regard.
Tata Motors recognizes the importance of fostering an inclusive environment where Persons with Disabilities (PWD) are
not just accommodated but actively empowered. As part of our commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), we
are embarking on a strategic initiative to integrate differently abled employees candidates seamlessly into our workforce.
This strategy employs a multifaceted approach, encompassing proactive audits, civil works enhancements, along with
parallel comprehensive sensitization programs.
This approach ensures that our efforts are comprehensive and holistic, leaving no stone unturned in creating an environment
conducive to the success of differently abled employees candidates.
Proactive Audits: We are in the process of conducting various accessibility audits of infrastructure and buildings to identify
barriers and areas for improvement in accommodating differently abled employees candidates. These audits will be
conducted in collaboration with experts in accessibility and disability rights, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations
and standards like the Harmonized Guidelines and Standards for Universal Accessibility in India - 2021, released by the
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.
Civil Works Enhancements: We will initiate civil works enhancements aimed at eliminating physical barriers and creating
accessible spaces for differently abled employees candidates. This includes, but is not limited to, installing ramps, accessible
restroom facilities, tactile markers, and ergonomic workstations—ensuring that our workplaces are truly inclusive.
Comprehensive Sensitization Programs: We understand that creating an inclusive environment goes beyond physical
accommodations; it requires a shift in mindset and cultural norms. Therefore, we will continue conducting workshops
called ONEderful Conversations that help comprehend the various defined DEI aspects. These half-day workshop are
specially curated and delivered by trained facilitators from the diverse business domains to drive the agenda to the last
level employee. The program is aimed at raising awareness, dispelling myths, and fostering empathy among employees.
Underlining Message of Inclusivity: Throughout our DEI communication, we will underline the message of inclusivity,
emphasizing our intent to create an environment where every individual, regardless of ability, feels valued and respected.
Our communication is long-term focused and highlights the intent behind our actions—underscoring our commitment to
diversity and inclusion as one of our foundational beliefs.
Readiness for Visitors and Employees: In addition to catering to our employees, we will ensure that our facilities are
equally accessible and accommodating for visitors, including clients, partners, and stakeholders. This ensures that our
commitment to inclusivity is evident not only within our workforce but also in our interactions with external parties. We
are in the process of building a uniform experience across locations.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and workers?
If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief:
Yes/No, (if Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)

Permanent Workers

Yes. Tata Motors has a three-stage dedicated grievance redressal forum operating at various levels. These
forums—Joint Shop Council (JSC), Joint Divisional Council (JDC), and Joint Management Council (JMC)—
are strategically located at the Shop, Division, and Plant levels, respectively. They serve as platforms
where workmen can voice their grievances, ensuring that their concerns are heard and addressed in a
timely and appropriate manner. The closure of grievances is also monitored at the Plant level.
Furthermore, for contract labour, we have Business Partner Forums to address their grievances. In
addition, we provide helpline numbers and grievance drop boxes as alternate mechanisms to ensure
accessibility and inclusivity in grievance redressal.

Other than Permanent
Workers

The Company has adopted the Tata Code of Conduct (TCoC), which outlines our commitment to ethical
conduct. All internal and external stakeholders of the Tata Group are expected to operate within the
framework of this Code. Training and awareness programs on the TCoC are conducted regularly for
employees and relevant stakeholders.
We also have dedicated Human Rights and Whistleblower Policies. The Company has established a
robust governance mechanism to ensure confidentiality and protect whistleblowers from harassment
or victimization, including retaliation, threats, termination/suspension of service, disciplinary action,
transfer, demotion, denial of promotion, or any other form of intimidation. This protection also extends
to prevent any direct or indirect misuse of authority to obstruct a whistleblower’s right to perform their
duties or to make further protected disclosures.

Permanent Employees

The Company has a well-defined process to address concerns through the Ethics Committee, which
oversees due investigations.
Oversight of the TCoC, Whistleblower Policy, and Human Rights Policy lies with the Chairperson of
the Audit Committee and the Chief Ethics Counsellor. An ethics helpline is available for employees to
anonymously report any ethical violations. This helpline can be accessed in the following ways:
1.	A whistleblower can report concerns via the toll-free number: 000 800 0502 221, or through the
web portal: tatamotors.ethicspoint.com. Concerns can be submitted in multiple languages.

Other than Permanent
Employees

2.	Alternatively, concerns can be submitted in writing to the Chief Ethics Counsellor or the Chairman
of the Audit Committee.
In line with our commitment to gender inclusion and diversity, and to create a safe, fair, and just
workplace, the Company has implemented a Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (POSH)
Policy. The POSH framework includes several Internal Committees (ICs), along with an APEX Internal
Committee that acts as an appellate body and oversees dissemination of this policy.
We have developed standard guidelines to address sexual harassment, which are enforced by location
or subunit-specific committees at the Plant and Regional levels. This policy covers all women associates
(including permanent, temporary, contractual, and trainees), women service providers, and any woman
visiting the Company’s workplace. Any form of objectionable conduct is subject to strict disciplinary
action.

The performance of all management staff employees is managed through a performance appraisal process called
LOOP. The performance management process facilitates open communication between managers and employees to
clarify expectations, communicate organizational goals, provide feedback, and offer continuous coaching for improving
performance. This system employs a structured cascade of balanced scorecard objectives (at Business Unit level) all the
way down to individual targets, ensuring alignment across the organization. It integrates performance and leadership
behavior appraisal, with rewards based on both company performance and individual contributions. Compensation reviews
consider performance, leadership behavior, and market comparisons, ultimately aiming to enhance business outcomes by
defining and achieving goals effectively.

prioritized based on likelihood and severity, ensuring effective control measures.

		

A.

			

Routine Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment
•

Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA):

				

Conducted bi-annually to assign a Risk Priority Number (RPN) based on severity, likelihood, and exposure,
applying the Hierarchy of Controls (elimination prioritized). All assessments are digitally recorded for realtime tracking and trend analysis.

			

Continuous Safety Monitoring & Audits:

•

				

Safety observations, walkthroughs, and layered audits (factory, department, corporate) ensure control
adherence. Performance is measured via the Proactive Safety Index (PSI), combining proactive and incidentbased metrics.

			

Worker Involvement:

•

				
		

B.

			

Toolbox Talks and “TAKE 2” sessions engage workers in hazard assessment before tasks. Behavior-Based
Safety (BBS) observations promote safe practices.

Non-Routine Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment
•

Job Safety Analysis (JSA):

				

Conducted before non-routine or high-risk tasks, providing step-by-step hazard controls.

			

Permit-to-Work (PTW) System:

•

				

Mandatory for high-risk activities like hot work, confined space entry, electrical maintenance, work at
heights, excavation, and lifting, ensuring authorization and training compliance.

			

Access Control & Work Area Safety:

and worker participation to sustain a zero-harm culture across all operations.

c)

Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from
such risks.

		

Yes, Tata Motors has robust and comprehensive processes in place for workers to report work-related hazards and
to remove themselves from such risks. We firmly believe that a safe and healthy workplace is not just a desirable
outcome, but a fundamental right for every employee. Our commitment to this principle is reflected in the multifaceted approach we take to hazard reporting and risk mitigation. We empower our employees to be active participants
in maintaining a safe work environment, providing them with the tools, training, and authority to identify, report, and,
when necessary, immediately remove themselves from potential hazards. This commitment is not merely a policy on
paper; it’s a deeply ingrained cultural value, reinforced through continuous training, open communication, and a clear
understanding that safety is everyone’s responsibility.

		

1.

Multiple Reporting Mechanisms for Work-Related Hazards

			

•

Digital Safety Reporting Platform: Employees can report hazards and near-misses in real-time through a
dedicated digital system (Safety Portal) integrated into the company’s safety management framework.

			

•

Safety Observation (SO) Process: Workers identify and report unsafe acts, conditions, and near-misses for
prompt corrective action.

			

•

Action Employee Can Take (AECT) Program: Encourages employees to take ownership of safety by flagging
and mitigating hazards proactively.

			

•

Whistleblower Mechanism & Open-Door Policy: Ensures anonymous reporting and protection from
retaliation, fostering a culture of transparency and trust.

			

•

Self-Directed Team (SDT) & Self-managed Team (SMT) Safety Point Leaders: On-ground shop floor
representatives of self-employees and Business partners lead hazard identification and reporting programs.

		

Empowering Workers to Remove Themselves from Unsafe Conditions

2.

			

•

Stop Work Authority (SWA): Employees have the right to immediately stop work if they perceive an
imminent risk to health and safety.

			

•

Escalation Procedures: Workers can escalate unresolved safety concerns to safety officers, supervisors, or
the site SHE team for immediate intervention.

			

•

Joint Safety Committees: Employee representatives actively participate in safety governance, risk
assessments, and hazard control initiatives.

			

•

Incident Investigation & Corrective Actions: Every reported hazard undergoes root cause analysis (RCA)
and triggers corrective and preventive actions with follow-up audits.

			

•

Regular Safety Training & Toolbox Talks: Employees receive continuous safety training on identifying risks,
reporting hazards, and exercising their right to a safe work environment.

			

Through this comprehensive approach, Tata Motors fosters a safety-first culture where employees are actively
involved in hazard identification, risk reporting, and workplace safety improvements.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
We firmly believe in fostering continuous dialogue with our stakeholders, underscoring our commitment to transparency
and accountability. Our leadership actively engages through various platforms to ensure that stakeholder feedback—
whether on economic, environmental, or social matters—is thoughtfully considered and integrated into our decisionmaking processes.
We firmly believe in fostering continuous dialogue with our stakeholders, underscoring our commitment to transparency
and accountability. Our leadership actively engages through various platforms to ensure that stakeholder feedback—
whether on economic, environmental, or social matters—is thoughtfully considered and integrated into our decisionmaking processes.
To strengthen and formalize this engagement, we have established dedicated committees focused on key areas of concern:
•

The Safety, Health, and Sustainability (SHS) Committee plays a critical role in evaluating our performance across
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) dimensions. It oversees the implementation of relevant policies and
strategies that drive sustainable practices across the organization.

•

The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee is instrumental in shaping and recommending CSR policies to
the Board. It also monitors CSR budget allocations, activities, and expenditures to ensure alignment with our broader
commitment to social impact and community engagement.

•

The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee is entrusted with monitoring statutory compliances and ensuring the
smooth execution of services related to dividend payments, security holder communication, and the performance of
our Registrar and Transfer Agents—enhancing trust, transparency, and service efficiency in our investor relations.

	Furthering our commitment to shareholder engagement, we provide shareholders the opportunity to interact with the full
Board during the Annual General Meeting (AGM). This forum enables meaningful dialogue and helps us stay responsive to
the evolving needs, priorities, and expectations of our stakeholders.
2.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and
social topics. If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Tata Motors conducted a thorough materiality assessment in FY 2024-25 to pinpoint issues crucial to our value creation
process. We engaged with both internal and external stakeholders to identify material topics which were identified by
analyzing our ESG rating against various ESG frameworks. Customized questionnaires based on these topics were circulated
to stakeholders and the leadership team, who rated each topic based on its impact on business and sustainability.
Stakeholder responses were then prioritized as High, Medium, or Low, helping Tata Motors identify key material topics.
Finally, senior management reviewed these identified topics for further action.
Further these material topics have been taken to identify establish clear and specific goals that outline what the company
aims to achieve in addressing that issue.

3.

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable / marginalized
stakeholder groups.
The Company’s Affirmative Action (AA) Policy is specially designed to address the needs and concerns of socially
disadvantaged sections of society, i.e., Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SC and ST). Within the broader stakeholder group
of communities, the Company’s programs are mainly driven towards women’s health and empowerment, and the health
and education of children. The projects are implemented to ensure regular and continuous engagement with these
stakeholders, with measured outcomes and impacts.
The Company has also curated special projects to address the challenges faced by the most socially and economically
marginalised sections — the waste pickers and the migrants in Pune district. The aim is to provide dignity and a decent
quality of life for them and their family members. Special scholarships have been granted to their wards to mainstream and
continue their education.

In one of the instances, 15 workers bonded at Math Village in Ahilya Nagar District, who had passed through the hands
of four owners since October 2024, were exploited, provided with inadequate food and water, and kept under unhygienic
conditions, nearly forbidden to return home. With the help of the District Magistrate’s Office, efforts were made by our
team to reach their relatives, and all the workers were rescued and sent back to their homes in HOL village in Jalgaon in
March 2025. It was also ensured that all their dues were paid.

Is the premise / office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, as per the requirements of the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?
In an era where inclusivity is not just a buzzword but a fundamental aspect of societal progress, ensuring accessibility for
differently abled individuals within office premises has become a crucial endeavor. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities
(RPWD) Act of 2016 in India serves as a guiding light, mandating measures to ensure equal opportunities and access for
people with disabilities. As we strive to adhere to these regulations, they are presented with various strategies to enhance
premise and office accessibility, especially in locations that pose unique challenges.
Understanding the Landscape: Tata Motors is based out of from diverse locations, ranging from modern commercial
spaces to heritage buildings with historical significance. Each setting presents its own set of challenges and opportunities in
terms of accessibility. While some commercial locations may already boast inclusive premises due to modern construction
norms or proactive measures, older buildings may require significant retrofitting to meet accessibility standards.
Assessing the Need: To embark on the journey of creating inclusive premises, we are kick starting comprehensive
accessibility audits. These audits serve as invaluable tools in identifying barriers to accessibility and prioritizing areas for
improvement. By mapping out the current state of accessibility, we are developing a clear roadmap for action, ensuring
that resources are allocated effectively and efficiently.
Implementing Solutions: Once the audit process is complete, we can begin implementing measures to enhance accessibility.
These measures may include:
a.

Physical Modifications: Retrofitting entrances with ramps, widening doorways, installing handrails, and ensuring
accessible restroom facilities are just a few examples of physical modifications that can greatly improve accessibility
for differently abled individuals.

b.

Technological Solutions: We would also leverage technology can also play a significant role in enhancing accessibility.
From automated doors and elevators to assistive devices such as screen readers and braille displays, technology can
bridge gaps and empower individuals with disabilities to navigate office spaces more independently.

c.

Training and Sensitization: It’s not just about physical infrastructure; fostering a culture of inclusivity within the
organization is equally important. Providing training and sensitization sessions for employees promotes awareness and
understanding of the challenges faced by differently abled individuals, fostering a more inclusive work environment.

d.

Collaboration and Partnerships: We are also leveraging collaborations and partnerships with disability rights
organizations, accessibility experts, and government agencies to gain insights and support in their journey towards
creating inclusive premises.

Embracing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): Ultimately, the pursuit of accessibility within office premises is deeply
intertwined with broader efforts towards diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). By prioritizing accessibility, we not only
fulfil legal obligations but also demonstrate a commitment to creating environments where every individual, regardless of
ability, can thrive and contribute meaningfully.

Yes, KPMG Assurance and Consulting
Services LLP has provided reasonable
assurance on data reported under
this indicator.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If Yes, provide details of its coverage
and implementation.
Our operations in India extend across Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. The
management and disposal of treated effluents generated during plant operations are governed by the specific operating
consent orders issued by the respective State Pollution Control Boards, which our plants strictly follow.
In line with these consent orders, several plants have implemented tertiary treatment systems, such as Reverse Osmosis
(RO), to recycle treated effluents for reuse in processes. Others adopt a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) approach by repurposing
treated effluents for secondary applications, including toilet flushing and supporting greenbelt development within the
plant and surrounding areas.
This year, we have taken additional steps to conserve freshwater and optimize its usage. In Pune and Jamshedpur, for
example, we have reduced freshwater consumption by increasing the use of treated effluents in our processes. This includes
the installation of tertiary treatment systems with RO membranes and the utilization of treated sewage wastewater for
plant process water requirements from nearby sources—such as PCMC’s treated sewage usage at the Pimpri plant and
township sewage at the Jamshedpur plant. Furthermore, efforts are underway to enhance water sustainability through
rainwater harvesting and recharge initiatives both within and around plant premises. Tata Motors is committed to achieving
a ‘Water Positive’ status by 2030 in all its operations and townships.
Aligned with these consent orders/authorizations, plants have implemented comprehensive tertiary treatment systems,
such as Reverse Osmosis, to recycle treated effluents for process reuse. Others ensure Zero Liquid Discharge by
repurposing treated effluents for secondary purposes, such as toilet flushing and/or maintaining greenbelt development
within plant premises and adjacent green areas belonging to the plants. Moving forward, our approach will embrace
a holistic perspective, encompassing all aspects of water sourcing and its efficient utilization. Our ongoing efforts are
reducing freshwater usage by increasing treated effluent recycling for our processes and other sanitation purposes. Efforts
are ongoing to increase water augmentation through rainwater harvesting and recharge both within and beyond plant
premises, as Tata Motors strives toward achieving a ‘Water Positive’ status by the year 2030.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices
adopted to manage such wastes.
The waste generated from our operations is categorized into hazardous and non-hazardous, as well as recyclable and nonrecyclable types. Our waste management practices are governed by the Consent Orders and hazardous waste authorizations
provided by the respective State Pollution Control Boards in the areas where we operate. We are committed to promoting
cleaner production, waste minimization, and pollution prevention initiatives. Additionally, we focus on the principles of the
circular economy, including reuse and recycling, while ensuring full compliance with all relevant legal requirements.
We have also looked at innovative ways of reducing the moisture content of the ETP sludge through the installation of
sludge drying bed. The drying process takes place in an enclosed shed, where the floor bed is heated by circulating hot
water heated through Concentrated Solar Thermal to effectively remove moisture from the sludge. It is estimated that
around 30% of the ETP sludge disposal quantity will be reduced through the effective drying process.
We are committed to reducing the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our manufacturing processes. This is achieved

through design improvements and the thoughtful selection of manufacturing technologies and raw materials. We are
actively evaluating the environmental impact of our vehicles and identifying opportunities to enhance material circularity.
Additionally, initiatives have been introduced to assess the emission rates of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from our
painting operations, with the aim of improving our overall sustainability and environmental performance.
In terms of products, conscious efforts are made to eliminate the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals at the product
design stage. These efforts are driven by well-defined standards, processes, and systems, such as:
•

Implementation of projects to eliminate paints from polymeric parts.

•

Restriction on the use of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) as per the BRS Convention, covering 15 banned
industrial POPs (with 2 more under discussion), by releasing internal standards to follow during the design stage and
communicating these requirements to the supplier at the stage of the request for quotation. We are continuously
monitoring the POPs listed under the BRS Convention and working with our suppliers to identify alternative chemicals
as well as eliminate new POPs from our supply chain according to the timeline. To track the presence of POPs or any
other hazardous materials, we have developed an in-house IT system to identify these chemicals. This enables us to
provide inputs to the Ministry and SIAM and play a leadership role in creating awareness within the auto industry
about best practices.

•

Proactive compliance with the AIS-129 standard (which is not yet enforced) to restrict the use of four heavy metals
(Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, and Hexavalent Chromium) in vehicles above threshold limits.

•

Eliminating flame retardants like TDCIPP, TCIP, and TCEP in vehicle seat foam as per NGT order, which addresses the
adverse impacts of these chemicals on human health.

•

Development of an internal standard for material identification marking for plastic components weighing more than
100g and elastomer components weighing more than 200g. This helps enhance the recyclability of these components
at the end-of-life phase.

We are continuously exploring new approaches to monitor and improve our sustainability and environmental performance.
Initiatives have been implemented to eliminate paints from polymeric parts, phase out hazardous materials and Persistent
Organic Pollutants (POPs), introduce sustainable materials to enable energy savings in manufacturing processes, and
explore new strategies to improve our sustainability and environmental performance.

Note: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had passed an order in year 2011 which has been challenged and is
pending for hearing. Another order passed in 2023 has been decided in favour of TML but has been challenged before the
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal by the complainant. Details as under:
Case title: PV Auto parts case (Complaint filed by Mr. Shamsher Kataria): In the year 2011, CCI initiated the enquiry and
investigation against car manufacturers in India (including TML). Finally, CCI vide its order dated 25.08.2014 held the car
manufacturers of having indulged in anti-competitive practices. CCI, among other directives, imposed a penalty on TML
amounting to ₹1,346.46 crores. TML, along with a majority of car manufacturers, challenged the order of CCI and presently
there is a stay on CCI’s order. Now the matter shall be listed in due course before Supreme Court for further proceedings.
Case title: CV Abuse of dominance case (Complaint filed by Mrs. Neha Gupta and Mr. Nishant Bhutada): In the year 2021,
CCI ordered its Director General (“DG”) to conduct an investigation on the complaint against TML, TMFL and TCFSL for
concerting together to form a cartel, abusing their dominance in the vehicle market and causing irreparable financial losses
to its dealers. TMFL and TCFSL were dropped by CCI from the investigation. The DG submitted the report with CCI prima
facie holding TML guilty of imposing territorial restrictions on its dealers from selling the vehicles. TML filed its objections
to the DG’s report and, finally the CCI vide its order dated 23.08.2023 decided the matter is favour of TML thereby setting
aside the DG’s report and the complaints filed by both the informants. The CCI held that while TML is a dominant player in
commercial vehicles market, there is no case made out against it either under the provisions of Section 3 (anti-competitive
practices) or Section 4 (abuse of dominance) of the Act.
Mrs. Neha Gupta has filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) against the above
Order of CCI and the same is pending for further proceedings.

Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after
the date of this assurance report.
In connection with our assurance on the BRSR Core attributes,
our responsibility is to read the other information identified
above when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider
whether other information is materially inconsistent with the
BRSR Core, or our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to
communicate the matter to Those Charged With Governance
and describe actions applicable under the applicable laws
and regulations.

Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended
for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core
attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read
the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and

or

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing

Inherent limitations
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires
the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make
determinations about the relevancy of information to be
included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics,
some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions,
water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient
appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce
the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•

Planning and performing the engagement to obtain
reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures
in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the

than expected, with a slowdown in the real estate sector and
industrial activity. The Asia-Pacific region is projected to be

The automotive industry faced significant challenges amid
these macroeconomic headwinds. High interest rates and
tighter credit conditions in key markets such as the US and
Europe, dampened consumer demand, particularly in mass
market segment.

India accomplished a significant milestone, with the sale of
one lakh electric vehicles (EVs) in FY25. According to NITI
Aayog and the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), India’s EV
finance industry is likely to reach US$50 billion (₹3.7 lakh
crore) by 2030.
The Indian automotive market is expanding, driven by
rising income levels, urbanization and increasing consumer
purchasing power. Initiative like Production linked incentive
scheme are aiding several auto makers to invest in EV
segment. The industry is focusing on reducing emissions and
integration of advanced technologies like connectivity and
smart mobility solutions.

Global Economy
In FY25, the global economy experienced moderated growth,
influenced by persistent inflationary pressures, tight monetary
policies in developed markets and geopolitical uncertainties.
These factors contributed to cautious consumer spending
and disrupted global trade flows. Amid trade uncertainties,
global growth is expected to slow to 2.3% in 2025 from 2.7%
in 2024.
The US economy has been resilient, driven by strong growth
in the services sector, a robust labour market, and high real
wages. Europe, including the UK, has faced softer growth due

Management Discussion and Analysis
In FY25, we launched new nameplate with the Tata Curvv
and Curvv.ev, which was the first Indian SUV coupe in
the mass segment. The Tata Curvv combined stylish
design with performance, powered by a new Hyperion
GDI engine. The Curvv.ev also pushed boundaries
offering real range of more than 400km, while also
achieving price parity with ICE. We also expanded our
twin-cylinder CNG portfolio with the addition of the
Nexon iCNG, which is India’s first turbocharged CNG
vehicle. We strengthened the Nexon.ev with a 45kWh
battery pack offering more range to customers. We also
refreshed the Tiago with the Tiago 2025 intervention,
with reimagined interiors and advanced tech. At the
Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025, we showcased our
recent and forthcoming launches including the Tata
Sierra, Harrier.ev and Avinya X concept.
In the Utility Vehicles category, an increase of 11.4% from
388,486 units in FY24 to 432,735 in FY25, represented a
strong demand for Tata Nexon, Punch, Tata Harrier and
SUV Coupe. This also reflects customer preference of
utility vehicles over hatchbacks.
The decrease in the Passenger Car category (Tata-brand
vehicles in India) in FY25, represented demand of Tiago,
Altroz and Tigor, including CNG variant and EV variant.

Tata Motors made significant strides across multiple
vehicle segments with a focus on innovation,
sustainability, and customer-centric solutions. In FY25,
over 44 new products and 139 variants were introduced.
HCVs in India
Industry has registered a year-on-year decline.
Our volumes dropped by 8.6% in this segment. We
introduced the Signa 5521.S with the 5L TATA Turbotronn
engine for better fuel efficiency in return empty duty
cycles, alongside a range of alternate fuel vehicles like
the Prima 5530.S LNG and SIGNA 2820.T CNG. We also
launched the Prima 4830.T rigid truck, providing high
productivity with best-in-class features.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

ILMCVs in India
Our sales in the ILMCVs in India increased by 5.7%.
The Intermediate, Light, and Medium Commercial
Vehicle (ILMCV) segment registered robust growth,
driven by strong momentum in the MCV sub-segment,
customer-centric initiatives, and enhanced key account
management. Strategic product introductions like the
1416 LPK and 1616 LPT TRPCR addressed demand for
higher-rated payloads and specialized applications.
We further expanded the portfolio with high-payload
variants, including the 407 Gold+ and 710 LPT, catering
to the evolving needs of our diverse customer base.
SCVs and Pickups in India
Volume is down by 12.7%, as we faced challenges arising
from muted rural demand and tighter credit availability,
which impacted retail momentum. We solidified our
leadership portfolio with 11 new products, including
the Ace Bi-Fuel and the Ace EV 1000, offering enhanced
payloads and improved efficiency. The Intra V70 LNT,
along with the Intra Gold Series, further strengthened
our value proposition with higher load capacities and
faster turnaround times.
CV Passenger Vehicles in India
Our sales in the CV passenger vehicles in India increased
by 16.2%. The business saw the launch of the Magic Petrol,
a bi-fuel (Petrol+CNG) variant, making it an industry-first
in the minivan segment, catering to urban school and
route applications with improved performance for FY25
flexibility and operating economics. We also introduced
a new MCV platform for State Transport Undertakings
(STUs), powered by a 5.6L Cummins engine for optimized
fuel efficiency and reliability in Mofussil applications.
Additionally, we launched a 9m electric school bus with
a 10-year battery life, reinforcing our commitment to
sustainable mobility. In the intercity bus category, 13.5m
and 12m chassis equipped with EMR were introduced
for enhanced braking and safety.

	Jaguar Land Rover’s performance on a wholesale
basis:

normalisation of vehicle supply levels accompanied by
a strong demand for our products in the region. There
were challenging market conditions in China, particularly
for our locally produced cars - which operate in a highly
competitive environment - with retailer insolvencies and
credit availability also impacting volumes. Compared
to the prior year, retail volumes were higher in North
America 27% and UK 2%, whereas impacted in China
20%, Europe 9% and Overseas 4%.

Wholesales (excluding our China Joint Venture) for
the FY25 were 400,898 were flat, compared to FY24.
Compared to the prior year, wholesale volumes was
higher at North America 22%, and down in Overseas
12%, Europe 11% and China 10%. Aluminium supply
chain disruptions in H1 FY25 impacted our production
and consequently wholesale volumes in that period.
Wholesales were also impacted in the full year by the
gradual wind down of legacy Jaguar products, many
of which reached the end of their production life by
December 2024, ahead of the launch of all new Jaguar
in 2026.

Retails by powertrain
During FY25, we continued to offer electrification
options across our 13 nameplates, with plug-in hybrid
electric (PHEV) available on seven models and mild
hybrid electric (MHEV) available on eight models. In
FY25, electrified vehicles totalled 78.4% of our retail
sales (up from 75% in FY24) including 2% for the allelectric Jaguar I-PACE, 15% PHEV and 62% MHEV.

Jaguar Land Rover’s performance on a retail basis:
Retail sales for FY25 were 428,854 marginally down by
1 % compared to FY24. There was a similar story on mix,
with retail sales in North America increasing due to a

Management Discussion and Analysis
Range Rover’s historic home, JLR’s Solihull plant, is now ready to build pure-electric Range Rover models alongside internal
combustion and plug-in hybrid siblings. This highlights the incredible versatility of our Modular Longitudinal Architecture
(MLA) flex architecture on which Range Rover and Range Rover Sport are built, enabling us to offer powertrains that match
the demands of markets around the world. During the year we are installing the latest energy efficient paint technology
and filtration techniques to cut power and water use. JLR has also utilise fully automated spray robots which reduce paint
waste versus hand painting methods.

in FY24. Better mix, better management of costs, and
softening of commodity prices, have resulted in profits
for the year. The net profit (attributable to shareholders
of our Company) was ₹27,830 crores in FY25, compared
to a net profit of ₹31,399 crores. In FY24 deferred tax
credit was recorded in Jaguar Land Rover creating
deferred tax asset of ₹7,093 crores, in relation to
deductible temporary differences, including unused tax
losses, on the basis that it is probable that future taxable
profits will be available against which those deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. Similarly, Tata
Motors on a standalone basis recorded deferred tax
asset of ₹1,249 crores in FY24, on carry forward business
losses, as it is probable, profits will be available against
which these will be utilized in coming years. The net

246

deferred tax credit was ₹8,961 crores for FY24. Some of these assets (business loss) has been utilized in FY25 resulting in
reversal of deferred tax asset.
Profit before tax from discontinued operations for FY25 is the difference of fair value of investments of Tata Capital Ltd.
and the carrying value of net assets transferred as at April 1, 2024, of Tata Motors Finance Ltd. amounting to ₹4,975 crores.

Provident Fund Organization (“EPFO”), offered to
surrender its exempted Pension fund. Subsequently, the
Company incurred losses for three consecutive years
(during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling
for an automatic cancellation/ withdrawal of pension
fund exemption.
On November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court
ruled that those who were members of a statutory
pension fund as on September 1, 2014, can exercise a
joint option with their employer to contribute to their
Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible
to draw a higher pension calculated based on last 5 years
average salary. The Company accepted and approved
the applications filed by its employees for joint option to
contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal.
As per the actuarial valuation, an additional provision of
₹165 crores have been made for pension on higher salary
during the year ended March 31, 2025. EPFO, however,
redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the
Company’s Pension Trust. Considering this, along with
the fact that there was no positive movement towards
the conclusion of the surrender process of the pension
fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon’ble
Delhi High Court (“Court”) for seeking directions to EPFO
to immediately start administering TML’s Pension Fund.
The trade unions have also filed another Writ Petition
for expediting the transfer of pension fund corpus and
accepting the Joint Applications of the employees.
EPFO in December 2024, sent a recommendation to the
Government of India for cancellation of the Company’s
pension exemption, subject to fulfilment of certain
conditions. The parties had series of meetings to
channelize the migration of members data to EPFO’s
unified portal, prominently the joint meetings in April
2025, of which the duly signed minutes were filed in
the Court on May 1, 2025. It has been agreed in the said
minutes that EPFO will provide a facility on the Unified
Portal for the Company to migrate the members’ data
on EPFO’s portal. The Company will start contribution in
statutory pension fund w.e.f. wage month of July 2025.
Pension Trust will transfer the liability towards normal
pension valuation carried by EPFO. The Court took the
above minutes on its records and fixed the matter on July
23, 2025 for implementation of same as per timelines
agreed in the minutes.

Tax expenses / (credit):
Our income tax expense from continuing operations
is ₹10,502 crores in FY25 as compared to credit of ₹4,024
crores in FY24, resulting in consolidated effective tax
rates of positive 31.1% in FY25, compared to negative
14.2% for FY24. Current tax expense for FY25 is ₹5,023

crores as compared to ₹4,937 crores in FY24, whereas
there is deferred tax expense of ₹5,479 crores in FY25 as
compared to credit of ₹8,961 crores in FY24.
As compared to FY24, income tax expense is due to the
following reasons:
•

During FY25, Tata Motors Ltd has utilised deferred
tax asset on business loss of ₹1,211 crores and on
unabsorbed depreciation ₹763 crores, resulting in
deferred tax expenses of ₹1,827 crores. In FY24 Tata
Motors, recognised deferred tax asset on business
loss of ₹1,249 crores and utilised ₹1,029 crores
against the profit on sale of investments in FY24
resulting in net deferred tax credit of ₹157 crores.

•

During FY25, Jaguar Land Rover recognized
deferred tax expense of ₹2,855 crores as compared
to ₹7,094 crores deferred tax credit in FY24, on
previously unrecognized unused business losses.

•

There is tax charge on undistributed earnings
of joint venture, joint operation, associates
and subsidiaries amounting to ₹1,392 crores in
FY25 as compared to ₹1,043 crores in FY24, due to
increased profitability.

Share of profit/(loss) of equity-accounted investees:
In FY25, our share of equity-accounted investees
reflected a profit of ₹287 crores, compared to profit of
₹700 crores in FY24. Our share of profit (including other
adjustments) in the China Joint Venture was loss in FY25
was ₹28 crores, compared to profits of ₹253 crores in
FY24. Further in FY24 Tata Autocomp Systems Ltd. had
accounted for one time gain towards sale of land and
business, leading to higher profits.
Non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries,
net of tax:
The share of non-controlling interests in consolidated
subsidiaries was decreased to ₹319 crores in FY25 from
₹408 crores in FY24. The non-controlling interest has
reduced, due to merger of TMFL with TCL, interest on
perpetual debt. This has been partially offset by increase
in non-controlling interest of Tata Technologies Ltd, due
to sale of stake by TML during FY24.

Profit after tax:
Our consolidated net profit in FY25, excluding shares of
non-controlling interests, is ₹27,830 crores, as compared
to ₹31,399 crores in FY24. This was mainly the result of
the following factors:
•

Earnings before other income (excluding
Incentives), finance cost, foreign exchange gain/
(loss) (net), exceptional items and tax for Jaguar

•

Land Rover is profit of ₹26,830 crores in FY25,

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We finance our capital expenditures and research and
development investments through cash generated
from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and debt
and equity funding. We also raise funds through the
sale of investments, including divestments in stakes of
subsidiaries on a selective basis.
The key element of the financing strategy is maintaining
a strong financial position that allows us to fund our
capital expenditures and research and development
investments efficiently even if earnings are subject
to short-term fluctuations. Our policies for liquidity
and capital resources are appropriate for automotive
operations and are set with business specific sensitivity
analysis and by benchmarking our competitors. These
are reviewed periodically by the Board.

(i) Principal Sources of Funding Liquidity
		

Our funding requirements are met through a
mix of equity, convertible or non-convertible
debt securities and other long and short-term
borrowings along with working capital limits
from banks and financial institutions. We raise
funds from debt markets through commercial
paper programs, convertible and non-convertible
debentures and other debt instruments. We
regularly monitor funding options available in the
debt and equity capital markets with a view to
maintain financial flexibility.

Management Discussion and Analysis
The average number of flexible (temporary, trainee and
contractual) employees for FY25 was approximately 35,228
compared to 38,660 (including joint operations) in FY24.

BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE ORGANISATIONAL
CULTURE
At Tata Motors, culture is a powerful catalyst that fuels
performance, optimizes potential, and helps us attract and
retain top talent. Our cultural transformation is anchored in
the “More When One” framework, built on four core pillars:
Be Bold, Solve Together, Own It, and Be Empathetic. These
guiding principles shape our day-to-day interactions and longterm aspirations, enabling us to deliver exceptional employee
and business outcomes.
To bring these pillars to life, we have identified eight distinct
leadership behaviours—Agility, Risk Taking, Owner’s Mindset,
Empowerment, Collaboration, Accountability, Embrace
Diversity, and Passion for Customers—that serve as actionable
anchors across the organization.
We have adopted a consistent and inclusive approach to
our Employee Culture Survey, empowering our people to
voice their perspectives and actively contribute to shaping
our culture. The survey tracks three critical dimensions:
engagement, culture pillar scores, and change management
effectiveness. The results guide our efforts and reflect the
growing momentum in our culture transformation journey.
Through conscious, organization-wide efforts and active
employee participation, we have seen a marked improvement
in overall engagement scores—reinforcing the belief that
a strong culture not only drives results but also creates a
meaningful workplace experience.

CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT
Aligned with our cultural aspiration of being Bold, we
are committed to preparing our workforce to be futureready—embracing agility and risk-taking as core behaviours.
Empowering employees through continuous development is
central to this commitment. We are focused on enhancing
their functional, managerial, and leadership capabilities,
ensuring they remain future-fit in a dynamic environment.
The Tata Motors Academy plays a pivotal role in designing
and delivering capability-building interventions across the
organization. It caters to diverse workforce segments through
tailored learning modules in Functional Excellence, Leadership
Development, and Organization-wide Capability Building.
The Academy’s efforts are anchored in four key functional
pillars—Customer
Excellence,
Product
Leadership,
Operational Excellence, and Management Education. Special
emphasis is placed on priority areas such as ACESS, AI, Digital,
Industry 4.0, and ESG, helping employees stay ahead of the

curve. These initiatives not only build strategic capabilities
but also foster a culture of self-driven learning and growth.

TALENT MANAGEMENT
At Tata Motors, we are committed to building a strong
leadership pipeline and nurturing talent across all levels to
create a true Talent Factory. Through our annual Organizational
& Talent Review and robust succession planning, we identify
and develop potential leaders for critical roles. Development
programmes are designed based on talent assessments and
are delivered in partnership with premier global business
schools, TMTC, and other knowledge partners. Initiatives
such as Leadership Trails 2.0 for senior leadership and Inner
Circle, for high-potential mid- and junior-level managers are
examples of our focused leadership development efforts. We
offer a fast-track career growth programme for junior-level
staff aspiring for higher-level roles, featuring a dedicated
two-year development journey that includes multiple crossfunctional stints, a General Management Programme with a
premier management institute, and leadership development
interventions with esteemed external partners. We also
promote internal mobility through job rotations and our
Career Explore portal, offering cross-functional and crosslocation opportunities.
In line with our vision of becoming a learning organization,
we actively support higher education for employees. Over
1,350 employees are currently pursuing diplomas, B.Tech,
M.Tech, MBAs, and Ph.Ds in areas like AI/ML, EV Technology,
and Customer Excellence—enhancing both individual and
organizational capabilities.

SKILL DEVELOPMENT
In our pursuit of excellence in craftsmanship and
manufacturing, we continue to strengthen our focus on skill
enhancement to deliver high-quality products. To keep pace
with rapid technological disruptions and evolving market
demands, we have implemented the ‘Future of Workplace’
strategy. This initiative equips our workforce with futureready skills in areas such as High Voltage (Electric Vehicles),
Mechatronics (Industry 4.0), Auto Electronics, and Vehicle
Communication. Alongside reskilling our permanent
employees, we are building a digitally enabled, agile,
and young talent pipeline through our flagship full-time
apprenticeship programme in new craftsman trades.
We have also introduced an industry-first ‘Earn n Learn’
initiative under the brand name Kaushalya. This programme
recruits ITI/XII students, trains them in basic skills, and places
them on shopfloor On-the-Job Training (OJT). Over 2–3 years,
participants pursue a ‘Diploma in Mechatronics,’ attending
classes once a week and gaining hands-on experience five
days a week. The curriculum and OJT are specifically designed
to develop skills in EVs and Industry 4.0. Graduates of the

Kaushalya programme are subsequently employed by our
channel partners and vendors, creating a robust talent
ecosystem for the future. Over the past three years, the
program has benefited more than 16,000 individuals and more
than 1,672 trainees have been placed across the ecosystem.

Following its successful acquisition and assimilation of
Sanand-2 into Tata Motors, the new facility has now
transitioned into full-fledged production. This marks a
significant milestone in our growth journey. To enable
a seamless integration and empower the workforce,
multiple initiatives have been rolled out across key
focus areas—Culture, Capability Building, Higher
Education, Health & Well-being, and Collaboration &
Communication. These efforts are aimed at fostering a
cohesive work environment, aligned with Tata Motors’
values, and building a future-ready, engaged workforce.

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
We have labour unions for our technicians at all our plants
across India except the Dharwad plant. The Company
maintains cordial relations with its employees at its factories
and offices and has been supported by the unions in the
implementation of several reforms to improve safety, quality,
cost erosion and enhance productivity across all locations.
Technicians and unions have supported business continuity
to achieve productivity levels during challenging times caused
by COVID-19 and the semi-conductor supply chain crisis.
Employee wages are paid in accordance with the wage
settlements signed that have varying terms (typically three
to five years) at different locations. The expiration dates of
the wage agreements for various locations/subsidiaries are

women face at work and beyond, offering tools and insights
through interactive sessions. In FY25, it engaged few
women across L3, L4, and L5 levels, focusing on leadership,
communication, negotiation, work-life balance, and mental
well-being. Participants benefitted from personalised
coaching, mentorship, and a supportive peer network.
The programme encouraged self-reflection, helped build
confidence, and strengthened leadership capabilities. Action

Safety
Our core aim is to maintain a workplace where Zero Harm
is consistently achieved. We continue to focus on our three
safety pillars of Safe Place, Safe Systems and Safe People,
which provide the framework for our approach to continual
improvement on our glidepath to Zero Harm. Our Zero Harm
Metric tracks our progress on this journey, and over the past
12 months we have seen a sustained gradual improvement in
the metric - a reflection of the reduced number of accidents
in our workplaces over the last year. The Zero Harm Metric is
tracked at Board level as one of the Enterprise KPIs.
We continue to focus on our internal auditing programmes
and data aggregation and analysis capabilities to understand
where there are opportunities for further improvement.
Our programme of safety process automation contributes
to us meeting the requirements set out in our Safety
Management System, allowing us to monitor and analyse
data in real-time, quickly identifying and addressing potential

status, improving the health and wellbeing of our colleagues,
and agency and supply chain partners, working with local
health services and the communities we are part of across
the globe.
We offer all colleagues access to a range of services to help
them look after their wellbeing. These services include
musculoskeletal, mental health, nutrition, fitness, sleep,
addiction, mindfulness and other therapies as well as financial
information and support. In the UK, we also offer mental
health training for managers and colleagues and have trained
more than 200 Mental Health First Aiders since launching the
programme in early 2024.
We have a global approach to wellbeing and have created
eight regional Wellbeing Centres in three different countries

markets. We supported our employees with over 32,000
individualised sessions. One UK based health coaching
programme, LeadWell, supported 1,500 colleagues and
achieved satisfaction rates of up to +92 NPS.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION
Nothing is more important than our people and their
experiences. We have made incredible strides in nurturing
a workplace that is welcoming and rewarding for everyone,
where training, coaching and new policies support people
with opportunities to grow and thrive.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is becoming an everchallenging topic globally; however, we believe that we must
reflect the diversity of the world in which our colleagues and
clients live. We are committed to our cultural transformation
to create a positive, inclusive environment where everyone
feels respected, valued and cared for.
To do this we are taking action to make tangible impact,

Our Global Reach
Our global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policy details our
continued commitment to creating a safe, diverse, equitable
and inclusive workplace. Since 2022, our Global DEI team has
been working on our Global Digital Learning Experience in
response to the DEI basics learning originally launched in the
UK. The objective of this project was to develop a DEI learning
that resonates with people across our global locations. In
2024, the Global Digital Learning Experience launched across
24 countries and regions, educating on cultural nuances while
navigating local laws and cultural complexity, which are all at
different stages of the DEI journey.
In September 2024, we hosted our second Diversity, Equity
and Inclusion Summit, welcoming 960 participants in person,
and over 6,000 online, spanning 25 countries and 22 watch
parties. This event celebrates the progress we make year on

and ethical behaviour. The Company follows the philosophy
of building sustainable businesses that are rooted in the
community and demonstrates care for the environment.
As a global organisation, the Corporate Governance practices
followed by the Company and its subsidiaries are compatible
with international standards and best practices. Through the
Governance mechanism in the Company, the Board along
with its Committees undertakes its fiduciary responsibilities
to all its stakeholders by ensuring transparency, fair play and
independence in its decision making.
The Company has adopted the Tata Code of Conduct (‘TCoC’)
for its employees, including the Whole-time Directors
(‘WTDs’), which encompasses an appropriate mechanism
to report any concern pertaining to non-adherence to the
said Code. In addition, the Company has adopted a Code
of Conduct for its Non-Executive Directors (‘NEDs’) which
includes a Code of Conduct for Independent Directors
(‘IDs’), as specified under Schedule IV to the Companies Act,
2013 (‘the Act’) and Regulation 26(3) of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘SEBI Listing Regulations’).
Pursuant to Regulation 26(5) of the SEBI Listing Regulations,
all members of the Senior Management have confirmed that
there are no material, financial and commercial transactions
wherein they have a personal interest that may have a
potential conflict with the interest of the Company at large.

the Company as on March 31, 2025 have affirmed compliance

Scorecard methodology, for tracking progress on long-term
strategic objectives and the adoption of the Tata Code of
Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading and the Code of
Corporate Disclosure Practices (‘Prevention of Insider Trading
Code’), pursuant to the provisions of Regulations 8 and 9
under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations,

Board Diversity: To ensure that a transparent Board
nomination process is in place, that encourages diversity

appropriate blend of functional and industry expertise.
As on March 31, 2025, our nine member Board of Directors,

consisted of one ED, one NINED and seven IDs, out of
which three were Women IDs. Whilst recommending the
appointment of a Director, the NRC considers the manner in
which, the function and domain expertise of the individual,
could contribute to the overall skill-domain mix of the Board
and is supported by the Tata Group Human Resource Function
in this regard.
Key Board Skills, Expertise and Competencies: As on
March 31, 2025, the Board comprised of qualified members
who bring in the required skills, competence and expertise to

The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the regulatory and
other approvals including from the Hon’ble NCLT a Scheme of Arrangement (‘Scheme’) for reduction, through cancellation
of the entire ‘A’ Ordinary Share capital and in consideration thereof, issue and allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the
Company, in the manner as contemplated in the Scheme.
The Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 1, 2024.
Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’ Ordinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crore) and issued and allotted
35,59,52,028 New Ordinary Shares of ₹2.00 each (₹71 crore) to TML Securities Trust, in terms of the Scheme. TML Securities
Trust was able to credit New ordinary Shares to the respective ‘A’ Ordinary shareholders, except 173,389 New Ordinary
Shares. Of these 86,411 New Ordinary Shares, have been transferred to Investors Education and Protection Fund on
March 13, 2025.
Since the extinguished and cancelled ‘A’ Ordinary Shares under the Scheme included the ‘A’ Ordinary Shares already
transferred to IEPFA, the Company had requested the IEPFA for a waiver from transferring the corresponding New Ordinary
Shares to IEPFA and, instead, proposed to credit the same directly into the Demat account of the eligible ‘A’ Ordinary
Shareholders. This was initiated in order to avoid repetition of the process of reclaiming the New Ordinary Shares by these
shareholders from IEPFA. While the IEPFA acknowledged the issue, the Company could not obtain the requisite waiver from
IEPFA in the absence of any specific legislations in this regard. In view of the above, the Company transferred the requisite
number of New Ordinary Shares and amount in cash to the designated accounts of the IEPFA before March 31, 2025.
Whilst the Company and/ or it’s RTA send out communication’s to the Members, Debenture holders and Depositors
informing them about the due dates to transfer the unclaimed dividends/interest payments to IEPF, the attention of the
concerned stakeholders is again drawn to this matter through the Annual Report. The data on unpaid/unclaimed dividend
amounts and other unclaimed monies is also available on the Company’s website at https://www.tatamotors.com/
unclaimed-dividend/. Investors who have not yet encashed their unclaimed/unpaid amounts are requested to correspond
with the Company’s RTA, at the earliest. Members may refer to the Procedure for claiming the aforementioned amounts
transferred to the IEPFA as detailed on http://www.iepf.gov.in/IEPF/refund.html.
The Members who have a claim on the above dividend amounts and shares and other unclaimed monies may apply for
refund of the same from the IEPFA by following the procedure prescribed under IEPF Rules, 2016, as amended from time
to time.
Primarily, the concerned shareholder must submit the requisite documents and obtain the Entitlement Letter from the
Company. Thereafter, an online application in web-Form IEPF-5, as available on the website of the Ministry of Corporate
Affairs www.mca.gov.in, should be filed and the said form duly self-certified should be forwarded to the Company for
furnish the E-Verification Report, in the prescribed format, to the IEPFA. No claims shall lie against the Company in respect
of the dividend/shares so transferred. The Members/Claimants can file only one consolidated claim in a financial year as
per the IEPF Rules.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Tata Motors Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements
of Tata Motors Limited (hereinafter referred to as the
“Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company
and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”),
its associates, joint ventures, joint operations (including
its subsidiary company) and Trust, which comprise the
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the
consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other
comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes
in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the
year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements, including material accounting policies and other
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the
consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and
according to the explanations given to us, and based on the
consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate/
consolidated financial statements/financial information
of such subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and joint
operations as were audited by the other auditors, the
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in
the manner so required and in the context of the overriding
effect of the provision in the Scheme of arrangement as
approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (‘NCLT’),
regarding accounting of sale of discontinued operations from
the specified retrospective appointed date give a true and fair
view in conformity with the accounting principles generally
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the
Group, its associates, joint ventures and joint operations
as at 31 March 2025, of its consolidated profit and other
comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on
Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our
responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements section of our report. We are
independent of the Group, its associates, joint ventures and
joint operations in accordance with the ethical requirements

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial
statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant
provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with
the consideration of reports of the other auditors referred
to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section below, is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
on the consolidated financial statements.

Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to Note 51 to the consolidated financial
statements which describes the overall accounting and
the basis for restatement of the comparative financial
information for the year ended 31 March 2024 by the Holding
Company’s Management consequent to the Scheme of
arrangement (‘Scheme’) for merger of Tata Motors Finance
Limited (a step-down subsidiary of the Holding Company)
with Tata Capital Limited. The Scheme has been approved
by the National Company Law Tribunal (‘NCLT’) vide its order
dated 01 May 2025 with appointed date of 1 April 2024 and a
certified copy has been filed by Tata Motors Finance Limited,
with the Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra, on 08 May
2025. In accordance with the scheme approved by NCLT, the
Holding Company has given effect to the Scheme from the
retrospective appointed date specified therein i.e. 1 April
2024 which overrides the relevant requirement of Ind AS 110
(according to which the Scheme would have been accounted
for from 08 May 2025 which is the date of loss of control
as per the aforesaid standard). The financial impact of the
aforesaid treatment has been disclosed in the aforesaid note.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other
auditors on separate/consolidated financial statements of
components audited by them, were of most significance in
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
current period. These matters were addressed in the context
of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Capitalisation of product engineering costs as reported by the component auditor of Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC
(hereinafter referred to as JLR Group)
See Note 6 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

Accounting Treatment

The audit procedures applied by the auditor of the component
(JLR Group) included:

The JLR Group has historically capitalised a significant
portion of its product development costs. A key judgment is - 	Control operation: Tested controls including in relation
to the Directors’ assessment as to whether product
involved in determining whether these costs meet the criteria
engineering costs are eligible for capitalisation;
for capitalisation.
These include confirming the technical feasibility of developing the asset for use or for sale and ensuring that
the costs capitalised are directly attributable. There is a risk
that the JLR Group may capitalise costs that do not meet
this criteria.
In addition, it is noted that there is a risk of fraud around
the allocation of directly attributable expenditure to the
correct project codes to ensure appropriate costs are
being capitalised.

Personnel interviews: Corroborated judgements made
by the Directors around the continuation of capitalisation
of product engineering costs through discussions with
project level staff;

-

Tests of details: For a sample of product engineering
costs identified by the Directors as being eligible for
capitalisation, agreed that their nature was consistent
with the description of the account to which those
costs were recorded, and the timing of recognition
was appropriate. In addition, the component auditor
inspected any reallocations from accounts ineligible for
capitalisation to accounts that are eligible as capitalised
project engineering costs, which the component auditor
would consider to meet the criteria of a high risk journal,
and obtained evidence to assess the appropriateness of
the reallocation; and

-

Assessing transparency: Assessed the adequacy of the
Group’s disclosures in respect of the key judgements
made relating to the nature of the costs capitalised.

Component auditor’s sector experience: Critically
assessed the Directors’ judgements regarding product
engineering costs identified by the Directors as being
eligible for capitalisation against both the accounting
standards and our experience of practical application of
these standards in other companies;

Valuation of defined benefit plan obligations as reported by the component auditor of JLR Group
See Note 36 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

Subjective valuation

The audit procedures applied by the auditor of the component
(JLR Group) included:

Small changes in the assumptions applied in the valuation
of the liabilities, being the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality/life expectancy used to value the JLR Group’s
pension obligation (before deducting scheme assets) would
have a significant effect on the JLR Group’s net pension surplus.
The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk
assessment, we determined that the JLR Group’s pension
obligation has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than
our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and
possibly many times that amount.

2024-25

Control operation: Tested controls operating over the
assumptions applied in the valuation and inspected the
JLR Group’s annual evaluation of the assumptions used
by its actuarial expert. Tested the JLR Group’s controls
operating over selection and monitoring of its actuarial
expert for competence and objectivity;
Benchmarking assumptions: Challenged, with the
support of their own actuarial specialists, the key
assumptions applied, being the discount rate, inflation
rate and mortality/life expectancy to externally
derived data;

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The financial statements (note 36) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the JLR Group.

Assessing actuaries’ credentials: Evaluated the
competency, capability and objectivity of the JLR
Group’s external experts who assisted in determining
the actuarial assumptions used to determine the defined
benefit obligation; and

-

Assessing transparency: Considered the adequacy of
the Group’s disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of
the obligation to these assumptions.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
•

•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the Management and
Board of Directors.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis
of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

future events or conditions may cause the Group and its
associates and joint ventures and joint operations to
cease to continue as a going concern.
•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding
the financial statements/financial information of such
entities or business activities within the Group and
its associates and joint ventures and joint operations
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the audit of the financial
statements/financial information of such entities
included in the consolidated financial statements
of which we are the independent auditors. For the
other entities included in the consolidated financial
statements, which have been audited by other auditors,
such other auditors remain responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the audits carried out
by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit
opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further
described in paragraph (a) of the section titled “Other
Matters” in this audit report.

We communicate with those charged with governance of
the Holding Company and such other entities included in
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate
with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,
we determine that a matter should not be communicated
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public
interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the consolidated financial statements of Tata
Motors Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section
of our report of even date)

Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements of Tata Motors Limited (hereinafter referred to
as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 31
March 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements of the Holding
Company and such companies incorporated in India under the
Act which are its subsidiary companies, associate companies,
joint venture companies and joint operation companies
(including its subsidiary company), as of that date.
In our opinion and based on the consideration of reports
of the other auditors on internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements/financial information of
subsidiary companies, associate companies, joint venture
companies and joint operation companies (including its
subsidiary company), as were audited by the other auditors,
the Holding Company and such companies incorporated
in India which are its subsidiary companies, associate
companies, joint venture companies and joint operation
companies (including its subsidiary company), have, in all
material respects, adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements and such internal financial
controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025,
based on the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements criteria established by such companies
considering the essential components of such internal
controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance
Note”).

Management’s and Board of Directors’
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The respective company’s Management and the Board of
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining
internal financial controls based on the internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements criteria
established by the respective company considering the
essential components of internal control stated in the
Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

financial controls that were operating effectively for
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,
including adherence to the respective company’s policies,
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable
financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable
to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements were established and maintained and
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements and their
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements included
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant
subsidiary companies, associate companies, joint venture
companies and joint operation companies in terms of their
reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below,
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements.

306

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with
Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements include those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorisations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial
Controls with Reference to Financial
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial

307

REPORTS

statements may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements/financial
information insofar as it relates to two subsidiary companies,
one step-down subsidiary company and one joint operation
company, which are companies incorporated in India, is
based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such
companies incorporated in India.
The internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements/financial information insofar as it relates to
one subsidiary company, three associate companies and
one associate company of a subsidiary company, which
are companies incorporated in India and included in these
consolidated financial statements, have not been audited
either by us or by other auditors. In our opinion and according
to the information and explanations given to us by the
Management, such unaudited subsidiary company, associate
companies and one associate company of a subsidiary
company are not material to the Holding Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

Background and operations

the investee, (b) it is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with the
investee and (c) has the ability to affect those
returns through its power to direct relevant
activities of the investee. Relevant activities are
those activities that significantly affect an entity’s
returns. The Company reassesses whether or not
it controls an investee if facts and circumstances
indicate that there are changes to one or more
of the three elements listed above. In assessing
control, potential voting rights that currently are
exercisable and other contractual arrangements
that may influence control are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
during the year are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the effective date of
acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal,
as appropriate.

Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries, collectively
referred to as (“the Company” or “Tata Motors”),
designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of
automotive vehicles. The Company also manufactures
engines for industrial applications, aggregates such
as axles and transmissions for commercial vehicles
and factory automation equipment, and provides
information technology services.
Tata Motors Limited is a public limited company
incorporated and domiciled in India and has its
registered office at Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. As at
March 31, 2025, Tata Sons Private Limited, together
with its subsidiaries and joint venture owns 42.51% of
the Ordinary shares and has the ability to significantly
influence the Company’s operation.

2

The Company’s subsidiaries includes the Jaguar Land
Rover business (referred to as JLR or Jaguar Land Rover).

		

The consolidated financial statements were approved by
the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May
13, 2025.

Inter-company
transactions
and
balances
including unrealised profits are eliminated in full
on consolidation.

		

Non-controlling interests in the net assets
(excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries
are identified separately from the Company’s
equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders
may be initially measured either at fair value or
at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate
share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets. The choice of measurement basis
is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount
of non-controlling interests is the amount of
those interests at initial recognition plus the noncontrolling interests’ share of subsequent changes
in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed
to non-controlling interests even if it results in the
non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted
for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of
the Company’s interests and the non-controlling
interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their
relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference
between the amount by which the non-controlling
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the
consideration paid or received is recognised directly
in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.
When the Company loses control of a subsidiary,
the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the
difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair
value of consideration received and the fair value of
any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying
amount of the assets (including goodwill), and

liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling
interests. Amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary
are accounted for (i.e., reclassified to profit or
loss) in the same manner as would be required if
the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of.
The fair value of any investment retained in the
former subsidiary at the date when control is lost
is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition
for subsequent accounting or, when applicable, the
cost on initial recognition of an investment in an
associate or jointly controlled entity.

		

Interests in joint arrangements

		

A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which
two or more parties have joint control. Joint control
is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an
arrangement, which exists only when decisions
about the relevant activities require the unanimous
consent of the parties sharing control.

		

Joint operations

		

Certain of the Company’s activities, are conducted
through joint operations, which are joint
arrangements whereby the parties that have joint
control of the arrangement have rights to the
assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating
to the arrangement. The Company recognises, in
the consolidated financial statements, its share
of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of
these joint operations incurred jointly with the
other partners, along with its share of income from
the sale of the output and any assets, liabilities
and expenses that it has incurred in relation to the
joint operation.

		

Joint ventures

		

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the
parties that have joint control of the arrangement
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
The results, assets and liabilities of a joint venture
are incorporated in these financial statements
using the equity method of accounting as
described below.

power of the investee. If accounting policies of
associates differ from those adopted by the Group,
the accounting policies of associates are aligned
with those of the Group. The results, assets and
liabilities of associates are incorporated in these
financial statements using the equity method of
accounting as described below.

		Equity method of accounting (equity
accounted investees)
		

An interest in an associate or joint venture is
accounted for using the equity method from
the date the investee becomes an associate or a
joint venture and are recognised initially at cost.
The carrying value of investment in associates
and joint ventures includes goodwill identified
on date of acquisition, net of any accumulated
impairment losses. The consolidated financial
statements include the Company’s share of profits
or losses, other comprehensive income and equity
movements of equity accounted investments, from
the date that significant influence or joint control
commences until the date that significant influence
or joint control ceases. When the Company’s
share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity
accounted investment, the carrying amount of that
interest (including any long-term interests in the
nature of net investments) is reduced to nil and the
recognition of further losses is discontinued except
to the extent that the Company has incurred
constructive or legal obligations or has made
payments on behalf of the investee.

		

When the Company transacts with an associate or
joint venture of the Company, unrealised profits
and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
Company’s interest in its associate or joint venture.

		

Dividends are recognised when the right to receive
payment is established.

(d) Business combination
		

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are
accounted for using the acquisition method.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the
consolidated statements of profit or loss as
incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the
conditions for recognition are recognised at their
fair value at the acquisition date, except certain
assets and liabilities that are required to be
measured as per the applicable standard.

		

Purchase consideration in excess of the Company’s
interest in the acquiree’s net fair value of identifiable

		Associates
		

Associates are those entities over which the
Company has significant influence. Significant
influence is the power to participate in the financial
and operating policy decisions of the investee
but is not control or joint control those policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the
Company holds 20 percent or more of the voting

assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is
recognised as goodwill. Excess of the Company’s
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities over the purchase consideration is
recognised, after reassessment of fair value of net
assets acquired, in the Capital Reserve.

		

Judgements

		

i)

Revenue recognition: The Company uses
judgement to determine when control of its
goods, primarily vehicles and parts, pass to
the customer. This is assessed with reference
to indicators of control, including the risks
and rewards of ownership and legal title
with reference to the underlying terms of
the customer contract. Refer to note 34 for
further information.

		

ii)

Capitalisation of product engineering
costs: The Company applies judgement
in determining at what point in a vehicle
programme’s life cycle the recognition
criteria under Ind AS 38 are satisfied, and in
determining the nature of the cost capitalised.
Refer to note 6 for further information.

(e) Use of estimates and judgements
		

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with Ind AS requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that
affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income,
expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of these financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses for the years presented. Actual results
may differ from these estimates and judgements.

		

Estimates

		

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed
at each balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised and in future periods affected.
In particular, information about significant areas
of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments
in applying accounting policies that have the
most significant effect on the amounts recognised
in the financial statements are included in the
following notes:

		

i)

Note 2(f) – Going concern assessment

		

ii)

Note 3, 6 and 7 - Property, plant and

(f) Going Concern
		

These financial statements have been prepared on
a Going Concern basis.

		

The Company has performed an assessment of its
financial position as at March 31, 2025 and forecasts
of the Company and JLR for a period of atleast
twelve months from the date of authorisation of
these financial statements (the ‘Going Concern
Assessment Period’ and the ‘Foreseeable Future’).

		

The Company and JLR have assessed their projected
cash flows over the going concern assessment
period. In developing these forecasts, the Company
and JLR have modelled a base case. The base case
uses the most recent Board-approved forecasts
that include the going concern assessment period
and include the forecast impact that the changes
made to US tariffs will have on JLR.

		

For the Company, the base case has been further
sensitized using more severe but plausible scenarios
considering external market commentaries and
other factors impacting the global economy and
automotive industry.

		

JLR has carried out a reverse stress test against the
base case to determine the decline in wholesale
volumes over a twelve-month period that would
result in a liquidity level that breaches the £1 billion
liquidity financial covenant. The reverse stress test
models an appropriate assumption in reductions
in demand across JLR’s product portfolio as the
primary risk on wholesale volume is now deemed
to be more likely to arise from demand rather

currency of Tata Motors Limited. Transactions in
foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange
rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Foreign
currency denominated monetary assets and
liabilities are re-measured into the functional
currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the
balance sheet date. Exchange differences are
recognised in the consolidated statement of
profit and loss except to the extent, exchange
differences on foreign currency borrowings which
are capitalized when they are regarded as an
adjustment to interest costs.

than supply given resolution of previously noted
supply constraints.
		

In order to reach a liquidity level that breaches the
covenant, it would require a sustained decline in
wholesale volumes of 43% compared to the base
case over a 12-month period. The reverse stress
test reflects the variable profit impact of the
wholesale volume decline, and assumes all other
assumptions are held in line with the base case. It
does not reflect other potential upside measures
that could be taken in such a reduced volume
scenario; nor any new funding.

		

JLR does not consider this scenario to be plausible
given that the stress test volumes are significantly
lower than forecast. JLR has a strong order bank
and is confident that it can significantly exceed
reverse stress test volumes.

		

JLR has also considered the impact of severe but
plausible downside scenarios, including scenarios
that reflect a decrease in variable profit per
unit compared with the base case to include
additional increases in material and other related
production costs. Under all scenarios JLR has
sufficient headroom.

		

Based on the evaluation described above,
management believes that the Company and JLR
have sufficient financial resources available to it at
the date of approval of these financial statements
and that it will be able to continue as a ‘going
concern’ in the foreseeable future and for a period
upto at least twelve months from the date of
authorisation of these financial statement.

		

For the purpose of presenting consolidated
financial statements, the assets and liabilities of
the Company’s foreign operations (having nonINR functional currency) are translated to Indian
rupees at the exchange rate prevailing on the
balance sheet date, Income and expenses items are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the
respective months. Exchange differences arising
on such translation are recognised as currency
translation reserve under equity. Exchange
differences arising from the translation of a foreign
operation previously recognised in currency
translation reserve in equity are not reclassified
from equity to the consolidated statement of profit
and loss until the disposal of the operation.

Goodwill
Cash generating units to which goodwill is
allocated are tested for impairment annually
at each balance sheet date, or more frequently
when there is an indication that the unit may
be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the
cash generating unit is less than the carrying
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount
of any goodwill allocated to that unit and then
to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the
basis of carrying amount of each asset in the
unit. Goodwill impairment loss recognised is
not reversed in subsequent period.

ii)	Property, plant and equipment and
other intangible assets

			

At each balance sheet date, the Company
assesses whether there is any indication
that any property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets with finite lives may be
impaired. If any such impairment exists the
recoverable amount of an asset is estimated

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
to determine the extent of impairment, if
any. Where it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
Company estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs.

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new
standards or amendments to the existing standards
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Rules as issued from time to time. During the year
ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS
117 - Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind
As 116 – Leases , relating to sale and lease back
transactions, applicable from April 1, 2024. The
Company has assessed that there is no significant
impact on its financial statements.

		

On May 9, 2025, MCA notifies the amendments to
Ind AS 21 - Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange
Rates. These amendments aim to provide clearer
guidance on assessing currency exchangeability
and estimating exchange rates when currencies
are not readily exchangeable. The amendments are
effective for annual periods beginning on or after
April 1, 2025. The Company is currently assessing
the probable impact of these amendments on its
financial statements.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
and intangible assets not yet available for use,
are tested for impairment annually at each
balance sheet date, or earlier, if there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.

(A) Accounting policy
		

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment, if any.

		

Freehold land is measured at cost and is not depreciated.

		

Heritage assets, comprising antique vehicles purchased by the Company, are not depreciated as they are considered
to have a residual value in excess of cost. Residual values are re-assessed on an annual basis.

		

Cost includes purchase price, non-recoverable taxes and duties, labour cost and direct overheads for self-constructed
assets and other direct costs incurred up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use.

		

Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when incurred.

		

Interest cost incurred is capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use for qualifying assets, based
on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings, if no
specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.

		

Depreciation is provided on the Straight-Line Method (SLM) over the estimated useful lives of the assets considering
the nature, estimated usage, operating conditions, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes,
manufacturer’s warranties and maintenance support. Taking into account these factors, the Company and its domestic
group companies have decided to retain the useful life hitherto adopted for various categories of property, plant and
equipment, which are different from those prescribed in Schedule II of the Act.

Estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Estimated useful
life (years)

Type of Asset

Buildings, Roads, Bridge and culverts
Plant, machinery and equipment
Computers and other IT assets
Vehicles
Furnitures, fixtures and office equipments

4 to 60 years
3 to 30 years
3 to 6 years
3 to 12 years
3 to 21 years

		

The useful lives and method of deprecation is reviewed at least at each year-end. Changes in expected useful lives are
treated as change in accounting estimates.

		

Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the
asset is ready for its intended use.

		

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized on disposal. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition of
an item of property, plant and equipment is included in consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Right of use assets
(A) Accounting policy

		Lessee:
		

At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is,or contains,
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company
assesses whether:

		

•

The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be
physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a
substantive substation right, then the asset is not identified;

		

•

The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the
period of use; and

		

•

The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision
making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purposes the asset is used.

		

•

In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company
has the right to direct the use of the asset if either:

			

•

The Company has the right to operate the asset; or

			

•

The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used.

		

As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for
any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this practical
expedient. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.

		

The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated dilapidation
costs, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of the leased asset
is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease
payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset.

		

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement
date, discounted using, the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the
Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. It is re measured when there is a change in future lease payments. The Company has elected not to recognise
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of
low value assets (lease of assets worth less than ₹ 0.03 crores). The Company associates the lease payments associated
with these leases as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

		

Lease payments include fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable
under a residual value guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to
exercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that
the Company shall exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right of use asset which comprises
of amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated
dilapidation costs.

2024-25

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
		Lessor:
		

At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based
on contractual terms and substance of the lease arrangement. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are
classified as operating leases.

		

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net
investment in the leases. Finance income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of
return on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

		

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

(B) The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which
have a renewal and/or purchase option in the normal course of the business. Extension and termination options
are included in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are
exercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether it
is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within its
control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will continue
to be monitored by the Company where relevant. The Company’s leases mature between 2026 and 2051.
		

When measuring lease liability, the Company discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate. The
weighted-average rate applied is 5.32% (2024: 5.89%).

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU as follows:

The recoverable amount has been determined based on value in use. Value in use has been determined based on future
cash flows, after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, growth rates and
anticipated future economic conditions.
As at March 31, 2025, the estimated cash flows for a period of five years were developed using internal forecasts, and a
pre-tax discount rate of 12.20% (2024: 16.22%). The cash flows beyond five years have been extrapolated assuming 5%
long-term growth rates. The management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not
cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit.

Other Intangible assets
(A) Accounting policy

		

Intangible assets purchased, including those acquired in business combinations, are measured at cost which is the fair
value as of the date of acquisition where applicable less accumulated amortization and impairment, if any. Intangible
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually to determine whether an indefinite-life assessment continues to be
supportable. If not, the change in the useful-life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

		

For intangible assets with finite lives, amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the acquired intangible assets as per the estimated amortisation period below

Product development costs

2 to 10 years

		

The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at each year-end. Changes in
expected useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

		

Internally generated intangible asset

		

Research costs are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the year in which they are incurred.

		

Product development costs incurred on new vehicle platform, engines, transmission and new products are recognised
as intangible assets, when feasibility has been established, the Company has committed technical, financial and other
resources to complete the development and it is probable that asset will generate probable future economic benefits.

		

The costs capitalised include the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overhead expenditure
incurred up to the date the asset is available for use. Interest cost incurred is capitalised up to the date the asset is
ready for its intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average
rate of all other borrowings if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.

		

Product development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any.

Impairment assessment of Jaguar Land Rover Business
The operations of subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), excluding equity accounted investments, represents a single cashgenerating unit (CGU). This is because of the closely connected nature of the cash flows and the degree of integrated
development and manufacturing activities.
In accordance with accounting standard, management have performed an annual impairment assessment as at January
31, 2025 using the value in use (“VIU”) approach to determine the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”).
A subsequent assessment has been performed to the year end date which has determined that there have been no events
or changes in circumstances which would have changed the outcome of the assessment performed as at January, 31.
The impairment assessment determined that the CGU recoverable value exceeded the carrying amount by ₹ 63,101 crores
(GBP 5,700 million) (2024:₹ 68,267 crores (GBP 6,500 million) and therefore no impairment was identified. The decrease
in headroom has largely been driven by an increase to the value of the CGU offset by improved performance projections
forecast for future periods following cycle plan actions and other strategic changes. It was further determined that this
decrease did not require the reversal of the previously recorded impairment loss.
JLR has considered it appropriate to undertake the impairment assessment with reference to the approved business plan
that was in effect as at the assessment date. The business plan includes a five-year cash flow forecast and contains growth
rates that are primarily a function of the JLR’s Cycle Plan assumptions, historic performance and management’s expectation
of future market developments through to 2029/30.
In estimating the future cash flows management have given due consideration to the inherent uncertainty of forecast
information and have adjusted some of the assumptions in the business plan to take into account possible variations in
the amount or timing of the cashflows. In doing so, management has incorporated execution risks associated with our
‘Reimagine’ strategy and the transition to electrified powertrain into the VIU, as well as other risks that may impact future
cash flows.

Climate risk
JLR recognises that the potential impact of climate risk to areas such as supply chain, operations, and material and compliance
costs may result in variations to the timing and amounts of future cash flows. As such climate risk is incorporated into the
development of our forecast cash flows in the VIU by reference to our climate change risk assessment. These risks are
principally reflected by the risk adjustments related to the variable profit and volumes which would be most affected by
climate change events, for example, scarcity of certain commodities driving up costs and therefore adversely impacting
variable profit.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
Key assumptions
The assessment of impairment is based on forecasts of future cashflows which are inherently uncertain and are developed
using informed assumptions such as historical trends and market information. The key assumptions are:
i)

the recoverable amount is most sensitive;

ii)

involve a significant amount of judgement and estimation; and

iii)

drive significant changes to the recoverable amount when flexed under reasonably possible outcomes.

Variable profit per unit and volumes – The approach to determining the forecast variable profit per unit and volumes
is based on consideration of historical performance, the order bank, profit optimisation efforts and Group Cycle Plan
assumptions, along with the impact of risks on future cashflows discussed above. A small change in either assumption may
have a significant impact to future cashflows and for this reason, as well as the impact of risks associated with supply and
inflationary pressures on variable profit and volumes, the directors consider variable profit per unit and volumes to be
key assumptions. Further, the variable profit per unit and volumes included in the business plan are largely driven by an
updated portfolio, which includes estimates and judgements related to the transition to electrified powertrain, including
the introduction of new Jaguar.
Terminal value capital expenditure – the five year cash flows timing and amount are based on the latest Cycle Plan. The
terminal value is based on the best estimate of a maintenance level of capital expenditure which has been derived from
depreciation and amortisation expectations and funding requirements in responses to longer-term industry trends and
risks informed by those listed above, which are anticipated in the VIU calculation. Due to the judgement and estimation
involved in the calculation of terminal value capital expenditure, as well as the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to any
change in the value, JLR consider this to be a key assumption.
Discount rate – the approach to determining the discount rate is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a market
participant after tax cost of debt. These inputs are based on a typical build up approach, calculated using country specific
premiums without size premium and with an unlevered equity Beta with reference to industry peers. The decrease in the
year has mainly been driven by a decrease to the country risk premium. The discount rate is regarded as a key assumption
as it is the rate which drives the discounted cashflows used to determine the VIU of the CGU primarily due to the level of
judgement and estimation involved and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to small changes in the percentage.
The VIU assessment is sensitive to certain assumptions, such as Sales, General and Administration (SG&A) costs which
are not considered to be key assumptions, because significant adverse changes are not considered reasonably possible
based on the forecasting methodology, where historical performance has been adjusted for expected future cost savings.
Similarly, certain assumptions which involve greater judgement and estimation, such as growth rate, but for which even
relatively significant changes have a limited impact on the assessment are not regarded as key assumptions.

Sensitivity to Key Assumptions
The value of key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount are as follows, presented as a % of Gross Vehicle
Revenues (“GVR”) to demonstrate the relative value to the assessment where noted:

* Based on forecast variable profit per unit and volumes

Sensitivity to reasonably possible changes to key assumptions
Given the inherent uncertainty about the timing and amount of any change in key assumptions, as well as the significant
portion of the recoverable amount related to the VIU terminal value, JLR consider a net impact on terminal period cash
flows to be the best means of indicating the sensitivity of key assumptions.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

334

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
JLR considers the variable profit and volumes assumptions to be interdependent as movement in one assumption will
impact the other, impacting the overall variable profit. For example, the profit optimisation efforts discussed above will
likely result in higher average variable profit per unit with lower volumes whereas a focus on volumes would likely see
a reduction in the average variable profit per unit. Consequently, the terminal value variable profit sensitivity below
incorporates sensitivity in volumes via the impact on variable profit.
The table below shows the amount by which the value assigned to the key assumptions must change for the recoverable
amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount, none of which are considered to be reasonably plausible:

13 Inventories
(A) Accounting policy
		

Inventories (other than those recognised consequent to the sale of vehicles subject to repurchase arrangements)
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of raw materials, components and consumables are
ascertained on a first in first out basis. Cost, including fixed and variable production overheads, are allocated to workin-progress and finished goods determined on a full absorption cost basis. Cost of inventories also include all other
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. Inventories
include vehicles sold subject to repurchase arrangements. These vehicles are carried at cost to the Company and are
amortised in changes in inventories of finished goods to their residual values (i.e., estimated second hand sale value)
over the term of the arrangement.

Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through
continuing use, if the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and if the sale is highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are measured in accordance with the company’s accounting
policies. Once classified as held for sale, the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell. Any write-downs on initial classification or subsequent remeasurement are recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss.

months of the balance sheet date. During the year ended March 31, 2025 write-downs of amounting to Nil (2024: ₹ 63
crores) have been recognised in respect of assets held for sale where the carrying value of assets exceeded fair value less
costs to sell.

22 Income taxes
(A) Accounting policy
		

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit or loss (whether in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or where
they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination the tax effect
is included in the accounting for the business combination. Current income taxes are determined based on respective
taxable income of each taxable entity.

		

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation
carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable entity
and for each taxable jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable
income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry
forwards and unused tax credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
		

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on
a net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards can be utilised.

		

Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and
associated companies and interests in joint arrangements are not recognised if the Company is able to control the
timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

and Nil ‘A’ Ordinary shares (as at March 31, 2024: 2,33,214 ‘A’ Ordinary shares of ₹2 each) are subject matter of various
suits filed in the courts / forums by third parties for which final order is awaited and hence kept in abeyance.
(i)

Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to shares :

		

•

In respect of every Ordinary share of ₹2 each (whether fully or partly paid), voting rights shall be in the same
proportion as the capital paid up on such Ordinary share bears to the total paid up Ordinary share capital of
the Company.

		

•

The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to the approval of the shareholders in the ensuing
Annual General Meeting.

		

•

In the event of liquidation, the shareholders are eligible to receive the remaining assets of the Company after
distribution of all preferential amounts, in proportion to their shareholdings.

		

•

The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the
regulatory and other approvals including from the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”)) a Scheme
of Arrangement (“Scheme”) for reduction, through cancellation of the entire ‘A’ Ordinary Share capital
and in consideration thereof, issue and allotment of new Ordinary Shares in the Company, in the manner as
contemplated in the Scheme.

		

The NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 has sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 1, 2024.
Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’ Ordinary shares of ₹2 each (₹ 102 crores) and issued 35,59,52,028
new Ordinary Shares of ₹2 each (₹ 71 crores) to TML Securities Trust, in terms of the Scheme. The resultant difference
of ₹ 31 crores is recorded in Securities Premium Account. TML Securities Trust was able to credit new ordinary Shares
to the respective ‘A’ Ordinary shareholders, except 1,73,389 new Ordinary Shares. Of these 86,411 new Ordinary
Shares, have been transferred to Investor Education and Protection Fund on March 13, 2025. Remaining 86,978 new
Ordinary Shares are yet to be transferred to the ultimate shareholders/ beneficial owners by TML Securities Trust as
on March 31, 2025, are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements. These 86,978 new Ordinary Shares are
presently held in an escrow demat account of the Company.

		

The total expenses of ₹ 70 crores (including ₹ 53 crores for the year ended March 31, 2025) incurred on the cancellation
of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares have been accounted through retained earnings.

		

The issue of new Ordinary Shares as consideration for reduction by way of cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares, was
considered to be ‘Deemed Dividend’ in the hands of ‘A’ Ordinary Shareholders in terms of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
The TDS liability of the Company on the aforesaid ‘Deemed Dividend’, amounting to ₹ 1,073 crores, has been funded
through sale of requisite number of new Ordinary Shares, in the manner as contemplated in the Scheme.

33 Provisions
(A) Accounting policy
		

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the liability.

		

Product warranty expenses

		

The estimated liability for product warranties are recognized when products are sold or when new warranty
programmes are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and
average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future warranty claims, customer

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
goodwill and recall complaints The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being
typically up to six years and for batteries in electric vehicles warranty period is typically up to eight years. The Company
also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle fault is proven to be a
supplier’s fault.
		

The Company’s calculation methodology uses detailed historical data corrected for experience as information becomes
available as well as individual campaign assumptions (such as scope, uptake rates and repair costs). The calculated
provisions are compared to current spend rates to assess balances versus expected future obligations. This can lead
to changes in the carrying value of provisions as assumptions are updated over the life of each warranty to reflect
where actual experience differs to past experience, for example due to higher inflation or timing of claims impacting
disbursement curve analysis. However, there are no individual assumptions that can be reasonably expected to move
over the next financial year to such a degree that it would result in a material adjustment to the warranty provision.

		

The Company notes that changes in the automotive environment regarding the increasing impact of battery electric
vehicles presents its own significant challenges, particularly due to the lack of maturity and historical data available
at this time to help inform estimates for future warranty claims, as well as any associated recoveries from suppliers
due to such claims. The related provisions are made with the Company’s best estimate at this time to settle such
obligations in the future but will be required to be continually refined as sufficient, real-world data becomes available.

		

The discount on the warranty provision is calculated using a risk-free discount rate as the risks specific to the liability,
such as inflation, are included in the base calculation.

		

Estimates of the future costs of warranty actions are subject to numerous uncertainties, including the enactment
of new laws and regulations, the number of vehicles affected by a service or recall action and the nature or final
cost of the corrective action. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the inputs to these assumptions, it is
reasonably possible that the actual cost expenditure over an extended period of time could be materially different
to the estimate in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company continues to monitor
developments in global macroeconomic conditions and potential mitigation strategies, including the global tariff
environment, and adjusts the provision if required.

		

Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier,
adjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on balance sheet date. Supplier
reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset.

		

Third party claims and obligations

		

A provision is maintained in respect of legal and constructive obligations to third parties. This includes claims and
obligations related to supplier claims, motor accident claims, consumer complaints, retailer terminations, employment
cases and personal injury claims. The decrease in the period is driven predominantly by supplier claims as a result of
ongoing negotiations and lower levels of new claims.

		

The provision recognised is based on previous experience, which is considered as a reasonable assumption to estimate
the final settlement, if any, at the time of the claim. The timing and amount of outflows will vary with decreasing
uncertainty from the point at which each claim is received to when it is subsequently settled.

		Emissions compliance
		

The Company maintains a provision for sales non-compliant with legal emissions requirements for certain jurisdictions.
The best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the non-compliance at the balance sheet date is determined
by considering the ways in which the Company can mitigate non-compliance with the emissions requirements. These
include purchasing emission credits at the estimated market rate based on latest market information, or paying the
legislated fine amount where a market indicative credit price cannot be estimated; and, subject to the terms of the
relevant legislation, generating credits by producing and selling compliant vehicles in the future. Legislation is regularly
monitored for changes to the emissions requirements across the various jurisdictions relevant to the Company and
where changes or new legislation is virtually certain to be enacted, these are used as basis in determining the best
estimate for the provision measurement. The measurement of the provision at the balance sheet date does not
include the impact of credits forecast to be generated in the future via the production and sale of compliant vehicles.

		

The timing of outflows will vary and is not known with certainty. The actual cash outflow may differ to the estimate.

34 Revenue from operations
(A) Accounting policy
		

The Company generates revenue principally from –

		a)

Sale of products – (i) commercial and passenger vehicles and vehicle parts and (ii) Sales of other products certain software products and other automotive products.

			

The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of
variable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products
are delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks
and rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably
assured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of
variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the
contract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis.

			

The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary
depending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for
as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue

recognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the expected
sales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and
local market conditions.
			

Revenue is recognised on a bill-and-hold basis where vehicles, for example, are sold to the customer but are
retained in the Company’s possession at a vehicle holding compound on behalf of the customer ahead of being
physically transferred to them at a future time. In such arrangements it is ensured that the customer has obtained
the ultimate control of the product.

			

There are certain vehicles which are being given to the customers along with operations and maintenance of the
same. These are considered as finance leases and accordingly, revenue is recognised at the lease commencement
date at fair value of the leased asset. The cost of sales is reduced for the present value of unguaranteed residual
values. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales at the lease commencement date.

			

The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are
recognised net of their costs within revenues in the income statement.

			

The Company applies the practical expedient in Ind AS 115 and does not disclose information about remaining
performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This is because revenue
resulting from those sales will be recognised in a short-term period. The services included with the vehicle
sale are to be recognised as revenues in subsequent years but represent an insignificant portion of expected
revenues in comparison.

			

Revenue from sale of vehicles to customers combined with repurchase obligation is recognised over the contract
period as if it were an operating lease contract. This is based on the fact that the customers had not obtained the
control of the vehicle. The related inventory continues to be recognised in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet. The consideration received from the customers is treated as liability.

		b)

Sale of services - maintenance service, telematics features and extended warranties for commercial and
passenger vehicles, software support services and insurance broking services.

			

Income from sale of maintenance services, telematics features and extended warranties, including software
services are recognised as income over the relevant period of service or extended warranty.

			

When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty,
such services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is in excess of the
standard offerings to the customer. In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance
service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract
liability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold
separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary
method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company
estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on
similar services.

			

The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points
on the spend towards Company’s products. The reward points earned by customers can be redeemed to claim
discounts on future purchase of certain products or services. Transaction price allocated towards reward points
granted to customers is recognized as a deferred income liability and transferred to income when customers
redeem their reward points.

			

Sales of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time, any amount
received in advance is recorded as contract liability and recognized as revenue when service is rendered to
customers. Refer note 32(a) for ongoing performance obligation. Any amount of income accrued but not billed
to customers in respect of such contracts is recorded as a contract asset. Such contract assets are transferred to
Trade receivables on actual billing to customers.

			

Refund liabilities comprise of obligation towards customers to pay for discounts and sales incentives.

			

Vehicle sales do not typically include allowances for returns or refunds, although in some markets there is
legislative requirement. Regarding other goods, where rights of return may be prevalent, the Company estimates

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

362

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
the level of returns based on the historical data for specific products, adjusted as necessary to estimate returns
for new products. Revenue is not recognised for expected returns - instead the Company recognises a refund
liability and asset where required.
			

Proceeds from sale of vehicles for which the Company or any of its subsidiaries have retained buy back obligation
in future is recorded as a liability – (i) Proceeds received in excess of agreed buy back price is recognized as
Deferred income liability and (ii) the agreed buy back price is recognized as Buy back liability. Deferred income
liability is recognized as operating lease income on time proportionate basis over date of sale and date of
buy back.

35 Other income
(A) Accounting policy
		

Other income includes export and other recurring and non-recurring incentives from Government (referred as
“incentives”).

		

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the
relevant conditions and the grant will be received.

		

Government grants are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, either on a systematic basis when
the Company recognizes, as expenses, the related costs that the grants are intended to compensate or, immediately if
the costs have already been incurred. Government grants related to assets are deferred and amortised over the useful
life of the asset. Government grants related to income are presented as an offset against the related expenditure,
and government grants that are awarded as incentives with no ongoing performance obligations to the Company are
recognised as income in the period in which the grant is received.

Accounting policy

		

The Company recognises compensation expense relating to share based payments in accordance with Ind AS 102
Share-based Payment. Stock options granted by the Company to its employees are accounted as equity settled
options. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of options granted that is determined on the date of grant, is charged
to the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the vesting period of options which is the
requisite service period, with a corresponding increase in equity.

Long Term Incentive Scheme – Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the company introduced a cash-settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for
certain employees. The LTIP is based on the value of phantom shares, which mirror the value of the Tata Motors Ltd
share price, but does not confer any ownership or voting rights. As the LTIP is cash-settled and based on phantom
shares, it is non-dilutive to existing shareholders. The LTIP vests over a three-year period, effective from June 2024.
The scheme will provide a cash payment to certain employees based on the Group’s performance against long-term
business metrics related to performance and strategic priorities and the share price of Tata Motors Limited over a
period of three years. This new LTIP has been accounted for under Ind AS 102 Share-based payments.

was ₹673.30.

		

During the year ended March 31, 2025, ₹ 54 crores was recorded as an expense in Employee Costs in relation to the

(a) Accounting policy

			

Pension plans

			

Jaguar Land Rover operate defined benefit pension plans for certain of its subsidiaries, which are contracted
out of the second state pension scheme until April 5, 2016. The assets of the plan are held in separate trustee
administered funds. The plans provide for monthly pension after retirement as per salary drawn and service
period as set out in rules of each fund.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

366

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
			

Contributions to the plans by the Jaguar Land Rover subsidiaries take into consideration the results of actuarial
valuations. The plans with a surplus position at the year-end have been limited to the maximum economic benefit
available from unconditional rights to refund from the scheme or reduction in future contributions. Where the
subsidiary group is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the pension plan above the accounting
value of the liabilities, an onerous obligation is recognised. A separate defined contribution plan is available to
employees of Jaguar Land Rover. Costs in respect of this plan are charged to the consolidated statement of profit
and loss as incurred.

			

Gratuity

			

Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries and joint operations in India have an obligation towards gratuity, a
defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lump sum payment to
vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount
equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion
of five years of service. Tata Motors Limited and such subsidiaries make annual contributions to gratuity funds
established as trusts or insurance companies. Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries in India account for the
liability for gratuity benefits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.

			

Bhavishya Kalyan Yojana (BKY)

			

Bhavishya Kalyan Yojana is an unfunded defined benefit plan for employees of Tata Motors Limited and some
of its subsidiaries. The benefits of the plan include pension in certain cases, payable up to the date of normal
superannuation had the employee been in service, to an eligible employee at the time of death or permanent
disablement, while in service, either as a result of an injury or as certified by the appropriate authority. The
monthly payment to dependents of the deceased/disabled employee under the plan equals 50% of the salary
drawn at the time of death or accident or a specified amount, whichever is greater. Tata Motors Limited and
these subsidiaries account for the liability for BKY benefits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.

			

Provident fund and family pension

			

In accordance with Indian law, eligible employees of Tata Motors Limited, it’s Indian subsidiaries and joint
operations are entitled to receive benefits in respect of provident fund, a defined contribution plan, in which
both employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a specified percentage of the covered
employees’ salary (currently 12% of employees’ salary). The contributions, as specified under the law, were
made to the provident fund and pension fund set up as an irrevocable trust or to respective Regional Provident
Fund Commissioner and the Central Provident Fund under the State Pension scheme. The interest rate, payable
to the members of the trust, was not to be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by the Central
Government under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any,
was made good by the Company. The embedded interest rate guarantee is considered to be defined benefit.

			

Severance indemnity

or TDMCL, a subsidiary company incorporated in Korea; has an obligation towards severance indemnity, a
defined benefit retirement plan, covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lump sum payment to all
employees with more than one year of employment equivalent to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed
year of service.

Under this unfunded scheme, employees of Tata Motors Limited and some of its subsidiaries receive medical
benefits subject to certain limits on amounts of benefits, periods after retirement and types of benefits,
depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company as part
of an Early Separation Scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under
the scheme. Tata Motors Limited account for liability for post-retirement medical scheme based on actuarial
valuation. The scheme is applicable to employees existing as at December 31, 2023.

			Compensated absences
			

Tata Motors Limited and some of its subsidiaries and joint operations provide for the encashment of leave or
leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are entitled to accumulate leave subject to certain limits,
for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the number of days of unutilised leave at each balance
sheet date on the basis of an actuarial valuation

			

Remeasurement gains and losses

			

Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on assets
(excluding interest) relating to retirement benefit plans, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income
in the period in which they arise. Remeasurement recorded in other comprehensive income is not reclassified to
consolidated statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses relating to long-term employee benefits are
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

			Measurement date
			

The measurement date of retirement plans is March 31.

			

The present value of the defined benefit liability and the related current service cost and past service cost are
measured using projected unit credit method.

			

The present value of the post-employment benefit obligations depends on a number of factors, it is determined
on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/(income)
for pensions include the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions
will impact upon the carrying amount of post-employment benefit obligations.

The Company’s policy is driven by considerations of maximizing returns while ensuring credit quality of the
debt instruments. The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on investment criteria prescribed
under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, and is also subject to other exposure limitations. The Company evaluates
the risks, transaction costs and liquidity for potential investments. To measure plan asset performance, the
Company compares actual returns for each asset category with published bench marks.

			

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at March 31, 2025 is 9.2 years (2024 : 9.74
years)

			

The Company expects to contribute ₹ 46 crores to the funded pension plans in the year ending March 31, 2026.

Jaguar Land Rover Pension plan

		

Jaguar Land Rover Ltd UK, have pension arrangements providing employees with defined benefits related to pay and
service as set out in the rules of each fund.

		

The UK defined benefit schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension schemes are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant
stakeholders in the scheme, is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the schemes and
all other governance matters. The board of trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan
participants in accordance with the plan’s regulations.

		

Through its defined benefit pension plans the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which
are detailed below :

		

Asset volatility

		

The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to corporate bond yields; if plan assets
under perform compared to the corporate bonds discount rate, this will create or increase a deficit. The defined
benefit plans hold a significant proportion of equity type assets, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds
in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.

		

As the plans mature, the Company intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that
better match the liabilities.

		

However, the Company believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the
supporting group, a level of continuing equity type investments is an appropriate element of the Company’s long
term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.

		

Changes in bond yields

		

A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an
increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings and interest rate hedging instruments.

Inflation risk

		

Some of the Company’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities
(although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against high
inflation). The plans hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts, together with other inflation hedging
instruments and also assets which are more closely correlated with inflation. However an increase in inflation will also
increase the deficit to some degree.

		Life expectancy
		

The majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy
will result in an increase in the plan’s liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK defined benefit plans, where
inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

As at March 31, 2025, the schemes held Gilt Repos. The net value of these transactions is included in the value of
government bonds in the table above. The value of the funding obligation for the Repo transactions is ₹ 10,683 crores
as at March 31, 2025 (2024: ₹ 7,331 crores).

		

JLR assigns an accounting level (1, 2 or 3) to asset holdings in order to reflect the level of judgement involved in the
valuation of an asset. In assigning the level JLR balances consistency between asset holdings, consistency from year
to year and manager/other assessments. JLR designates level 1 to direct holdings of liquid assets where an active
market exists.

		

Custodian accounts where underlying assets are regularly traded or where comparable assets have traded values
are designated level 2, for example derivatives (including net value of swaps) and some property holdings. Assets
which are not designated as level 1 or 2 are designated as level 3. Level 1 assets are reported as quoted, level 2 and 3
unquoted. Repo obligations are noted separately.

		

Private Equity holdings have been measured using the most recent valuations, adjusted for cash and currency
movements between the last valuation date and March 31, 2025. Given the movements in listed equity markets, the
valuation of Private Equity holdings may vary significantly. The value of the Private Equity holdings in the JLR UK Plans
included above is ₹ 13,284 crores as at March 31, 2025 (2024: ₹ 7,184 crores).

		

The sensitivity analysis below is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the
sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same methods (present value of
the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has
been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the consolidated balance sheet.

		

The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to
previous periods.

		In June 2023, the High Court handed down a decision in the case of Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II
Limited and others relating to the validity of certain historical pension changes due to the lack of actuarial confirmation
required by law. In July 2024, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal brought by Virgin Media Ltd against aspects of
the June 2023 decision. The conclusions reached by the court in this case may have implications for other UK defined
benefit plans including JLR schemes. The Company and pension trustees are currently considering the implications of
the case for the JLR UK defined benefit schemes. The defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the basis of
the pension benefits currently being administered, and at this stage the directors do not consider it necessary to make
any adjustments as a result of the Virgin Media case, however as further information emerges over the coming year
JLR will review whether and to what extent there are changes in its liabilities
		

JLR has taken legal advice considering the documentation of the UK schemes and the regulatory environment. This
confirmed the recoverability of any surplus in the scheme via reduced future contributions or settlement and JLR has
based its accounting judgement on this advice.

		

The average duration of the benefit obligation at March 31, 2025 is 12.8 years (2024: 14.2 years).

		

The expected net periodic pension cost for the year ended March 31, 2026 is expected to be ₹ 476 crores. JLR expects
to pay ₹ 399 crores to its defined benefit schemes, in total, for the year ended March 31, 2026.

		

Defined contribution plan

		

The Company’s contribution to defined contribution plans aggregated ₹ 1,919 crores and ₹ 1,708 crores for years
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Notes:
Tata Motors Limited (the “Company”) in October 2019 had by way of an application, addressed to the Employee Provident
Fund Organization (“EPFO”), offered to surrender its exempted Pension fund. Subsequently, the Company incurred losses for
three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic cancellation/ withdrawal
of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court ruled that those who were members of
a statutory pension fund as on September 1, 2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute to their
Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw a higher pension calculated based on last 5 years average
salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its employees for joint option to contribute on higher
salary on the EPFO’s portal.
As per the actuarial valuation, an additional provision of ₹ 165 crores have been made for pension on higher salary during
the year ended March 31, 2025. EPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s Pension Trust.
Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the conclusion of the surrender process
of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon’ble Delhi High Court (“Court”) for seeking directions to
EPFO to immediately start administering TML’s Pension Fund. The trade unions have also filed another Writ Petition for
expediting the transfer of pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of the employees.

EPFO in December 2024, sent a recommendation to the Government of India for cancellation of the Company’s pension
exemption, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions. The parties had series of meetings to channelize the migration of
members data to EPFO’s unified portal, prominently the joint meetings in April 2025, of which the duly signed minutes were
filed in the Court on May 1, 2025. It has been agreed in the said minutes that EPFO will provide a facility on the Unified
Portal for the Company to migrate the members’ data on EPFO’s portal. The Company will start contribution in statutory
pension fund w.e.f. wage month of July 2025. Pension Trust will transfer the liability towards normal pension valuation
carried by EPFO. The Court took the above minutes on its records and fixed the matter on July 23, 2025 for implementation
of same as per timelines agreed in the minutes.

or DRP. The Company has a further right of appeal to the Bombay High Court or the Hon’ble Supreme Court against adverse
decisions by the appellate authorities for matters involving substantial question of law. The income tax authorities have
similar rights of appeal.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
The Sales Tax Authorities have raised demand of ₹ 123 crores (₹ 227 crores as at March 31, 2024) towards rejection of certain
statutory forms for concessional lower/nil tax rate on technical grounds and few other issues such as late submission, single
form issued against different months / quarters dispatches / sales, etc. and denial of exemption from tax in absence of
proof of export for certain years The Company has contended that the benefit cannot be denied on technicalities, which
are being complied with. The matter is pending at various levels.
The Sales Tax authorities have denied input tax credit and levied interest and penalty thereon due to varied reasons
aggregating to ₹ 196 crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹ 250 crores as at March 31, 2024). The reasons for disallowing credit
was mainly due to Taxes not paid by Vendors, incorrect method of calculation of set off as per the department, alleging
suppression of sales as per the department etc. The matter is contested in appeal.

the local municipal authorities in respect of vacant land of the Company in the plant in Pimpri ((including residential land),
Chinchwad and Chikali Pune. The Company had filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court against an
unfavorable decision of the Bombay High Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court had disposed of the SLP and remanded the
matter back to the local municipal corporation for fresh adjudication. After fresh hearing, the municipal authority again

is expecting an additional demand of ₹87 crores for FY24-25 (₹119 crores for FY23-24) from the authority. The Company
believes it has a good case on merits to contest the matter and hence ₹416 crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹ 340 crores as at
March 31, 2024) has been disclosed as contingent liability.

Other claims
There are other claims against the Company, the majority of which pertain to government body investigations with regards

relate to the replacement of parts of vehicles and/or the compensation for deficiencies in the services by the Company or
its dealers.
‘The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”) by their order dated February 28, 2019, set out the principles based on which
allowances paid to the employees should be identified for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes of computation of
Provident Fund contribution. There are interpretative challenges and considerable uncertainty, including estimating the
amount retrospectively. Pending the directions from the EPFO, the impact for past periods, if any, is not ascertainable
reliably and consequently no financial effect has been provided for in the financial statements. The Company has complied
with this on a prospective basis, from the date of the SC order.
For Jaguar Land Rover (“JLR”) there are certain third party claims and obligations amounting to ₹ 2,287 crores as at March

43 Financial instruments
(A) Accounting policy
		

(i) Recognition

			

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or
equity instrument of another entity. Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when
they are originated. All other financial instruments are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

			

Initial measurement

			

Financial instruments are initially recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not
classified as at fair value through profit or loss. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant
financing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at fair
value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss

			

Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified.

			

Classification and measurement – financial assets

			

Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the
characteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and
past pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when
determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. The Company reclassifies
financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

			

Financial assets are classified into three categories

			Financial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates
to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held
within a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows
are classified in this category. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method less any impairment losses.
			

Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Equity instruments): These include
financial assets that are equity instruments and are designated as such upon initial recognition irrevocably.
Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other comprehensive
income, net of applicable income taxes.

			

Dividends from these equity investments are recognised in the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss when
the right to receive payment has been established.

			

When the equity investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to
retained earnings.

			Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Debt instruments): Financial assets having
contractual terms that give rise on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal outstanding and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold such
assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial asset, are classified in this
category. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses being recognised in
other comprehensive income apart from any expected credit losses or foreign exchange gains or losses, which
are recognised in profit or loss.
			Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit
and loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair
value through profit and loss are immediately recognised in profit and loss.

Classification and measurement – financial liabilities:

			

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as
at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense,
are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or
loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.

		

Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured
at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognized less, the cumulative
amount of income recognized.

			Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
			Equity instruments:
			

		

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Company after
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received,
net of direct issue costs.

(ii) Determination of fair value

			

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using another valuation technique.

			

The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the
consideration given or received).

			

In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset
or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability
at the measurement date.

			

Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted
in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities
held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow
method and other valuation methods

		

(iii) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities

			

The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to
another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an
associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also
recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is
recognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity
is transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value
through other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained
earnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company
reviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities.

			

Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged,
cancelled or has expired.

(iv) Impairment of financial assets:

			

		

The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a financial asset that is at amortised
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are forward looking and are
measured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time
value of money (values are discounted using the applicable effective interest rate) and uses reasonable and
supportable information.

(v) Hedge accounting

			

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, cross currency swaps and
borrowings denominated in foreign currency to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations
relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts, foreign
currency options, cross currency swaps and borrowings denominated in foreign currency in a cash flow hedging
relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses cross-currency interest rate
swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e. when
interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates. Hedging accounting is applied using both fair
value and cash flow hedging relationships. The designated risks are foreign currency and interest rate risks.

			

The Company uses non-deliverable commodity forward contracts to hedge risks associated with commodity
price fluctuations for highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these contracts in cash
flow hedging relationships.

			

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair
value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.

			

At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are
expected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value
of foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates amounts excluding foreign
currency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency
interest rate swaps. The Company designates only the pure price component of commodities in commodity
forward contracts. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts that are designated and effective as
hedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income
(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit
and loss.

			

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss or Balance
Sheet in the periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs.

			

For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are
treated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other
comprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge.

			

Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate
risk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income.

			

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated
statement of profit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an
adjustment to a non-financial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These
deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example
through cost of goods sold).

			

If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity
including deferred costs of hedging is immediately transferred to the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss
for the year.

			Fair Value Hierarchy
			

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below.

			

Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are
measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This
category consists quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments.

			

Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and
liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e; as prices) or indirectly (i.e; derived from prices). This level of hierarchy
includes Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.

Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial
assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither
supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based
on available market data. The main items in this category are investments in certain unquoted debentures
and equity.

Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments have been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value
because these investments are subject to a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents
the best estimate of fair value within that range. These investments in equity instruments are not held for
trading. Instead, they are held for medium or long-term strategic purpose. The Company has chosen to designate
these investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI as the management believe that this provides a more
meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value in
profit or loss.

			

Fair values of forward derivatives and commodity swap contracts are estimated by discounting expected future
contractual cash flows using prevailing market interest rate curves. Option contracts are fair valued using
standard options pricing methodology, based on prevailing market interest rates and volatility.

There have been no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

			

Valuation of Compulsorily Convertible Preference Share (CCPS) classified as financial liability is carried out by the
management using combination of Monte Carlo simulation approach which is a statistical technique that is used
to simulate equity value of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited and projected Cashflow discounted using
risk free interest rate prevailing on the date of valuation. Since significant unobservable inputs are applied in
measuring the fair value, financial liability is classified in Level 3.

Other short-term financial assets and liabilities are stated at amortized cost which is approximately equal to their
fair value.

			

The fair value of finance receivables has been estimated by discounting expected cash flows using rates at
which loans of similar credit quality and maturity would be made and internal assumptions such as expected
credit losses and estimated collateral value for repossessed vehicles as at March 31, 2025 and 2024. Since
significant unobservable inputs are applied in measuring the fair value, finance receivables are classified in
Level 3.

			

The fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price
and for other borrowings the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows, using a discount
rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return, adjusted for the credit spread considered by the lenders for
instruments of similar maturity and credit quality.

			

Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However, there
are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair
value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have
realized or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates. As such, the fair value of the financial instruments
subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different from the amounts reported at each period end.

			

Offsetting

			

Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are subject to offsetting where there is currently a legally
enforceable right to set off recognized amounts and the Company intends to either settle on a net basis, or to
realise the asset and settle the liability, simultaneously.

(b) Transfer of financial assets

			The Company transfers finance receivables through securitisation transactions and direct assignments. In such
transactions the Company surrenders control over the receivables, though it continues to act as an agent for the collection
of receivables. Generally in such transactions, the Company also provides credit enhancements to the transferee.
			

Because of the existence of credit enhancements in such transactions, the Company continues to have the
obligation to pay to the transferee, limited to the extent of credit enhancement provided, even if it does not
collect the equivalent amounts from the original asset and hence continues to retain substantially all risks and
rewards associated with the receivables, and as a result of which such transfer or assignment does not meet the
derecognition criteria, resulting in the transfer not being recorded as sale. Consequently, the proceeds received
from such transfers are recorded as collateralized debt obligations.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

392

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
			

		

Further the Company transfers certain trade receivables under the debt factoring arrangements. These do not
qualify for derecognition, due to existence of the recourse arrangement. Consequently the proceeds received
from such transfers with a recourse arrangements are recorded as loans from banks / financial institutions and
classified under short-term borrowings.

(c) Cash flow hedges

			

As at March 31, 2025, the Company have a number of financial instruments designated in a hedging relationship.
The Company and its subsidiaries use both foreign currency forward and option contracts, cross currency
interest rate swaps and other currency options to hedge changes in future cash flows as a result of foreign
currency and interest rate risk arising from forecasted sales and purchases and repayment of foreign currency
bonds. The Company and its subsidiaries have also designated some of its U.S. dollar denominated bonds as
hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship to hedge the changes in future cash flows as a result of
foreign currency risk arising from future anticipated sales.

			The Company also have a number of foreign currency options and other currency options, which are entered into
as an economic hedge of the financial risks of the Company. These contracts do not meet the hedge accounting
criteria of Ind AS 109, hence the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognised in the consolidated
statement of Profit and Loss.
			

Options are designated on spot discounted basis. The time value of options are identified as cost of hedge.
Changes in the time value of options are recognised in Cost of Hedge reserve to the extent they relate to the
hedged item. Changes in the spot intrinsic value of options is recognized in Hedge reserve. Changes in fair
value arising from own and counterparty credit risk in options and forward exchange contracts are considered
ineffective in the hedge relationship and thus the change in fair value of options and forward exchange contracts
attributable to changes in credit spread are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Cross
currency basis spread was historically included in the hedging relationship. Any ineffectiveness arising out of
cross currency basis spread is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as it arises.

			

Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative and bonds, to the extent determined to be an effective hedge,
is recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the fair value change is recognized
in consolidated statement of Profit and Loss. The fair value gain/losses recorded in Hedge reserve and Cost of
Hedge reserve is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transactions
affects profit or loss. The accumulated gain/losses in hedge reserve and cost of hedge reserve are expected to
be recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss during the years ending March 31, 2026 to 2027.

			

It is anticipated that the hedged sales will take place over the next one to five years, at which time the amount
deferred in equity will be reclassified to revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

			

It is anticipated that the hedged purchases will take place over the next one to five years, at which time the
amount deferred in equity will be included in the carrying amount of the raw materials. On sale of the finished
product, the amount previously deferred in equity and subsequently recognised in inventory will be reclassified
to raw materials, components, and consumables in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

(d) Financial risk management

			

In the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its
financial instruments.

			

The Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks
associated with the financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management
policy is approved by the board of directors. The risk management framework aims to:

			l

Create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate
fluctuations on the Company’s business plan.

			l

Achieve greater predictability to earnings by determining the financial value of the expected earnings
in advance.

			

Market risk:

(i)

				

Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may
result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change
as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price fluctuations,
liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with

(a)

Foreign exchange currency rate risk:

					The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated
statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance
sheet, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows, where
any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the respective consolidated entities.
				

Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are
subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily relate

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

394

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
to fluctuations in U.S. dollar, GBP, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Euro, against the
respective functional currencies of Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries.
				

The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments
primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Furthermore, any movement in the
functional currencies of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact
the Company’s revenues and expenditure relating to its international operations. Any weakening of the
functional currency may impact the Company’s cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently
may increase the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.

				

The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to
exchange rate risks.

				

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated for each currency by aggregation of the net foreign
exchange rate exposure of a currency and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift in the foreign
exchange rates of each currency by 10% while keeping the other variables as constant.

				

The following analysis is based on the gross exposure as of the relevant balance sheet dates, which could
affect the income statement. There is no exposure to the income statement on account of translation
of financial statements of consolidated foreign entities. Furthermore, the exposure as indicated below is
mitigated by natural hedges resulting from anticipated revenue and cost in foreign currency expected to
arise in future as well as certain derivative contracts entered into by the Company.

				

The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure (other than risk arising from
derivatives) contract as of March 31, 2025:

(b) Interest rate risk

					

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will lead to changes in fair value of
financial instruments or changes in interest income, expense and cash flows of the Group

					

The Company is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The
Company’s interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations. The Company also uses a mix
of interest rate sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its
day to day operations like short term non-convertible bonds and short term loans.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
					

In its financing business, the Company enters into transactions with customers which primarily result
in receivables at fixed rates. In order to manage this risk, the Company has a policy to match funding
in terms of maturities and interest rates and also for certain part of the portfolio, the Company does
not match funding with maturities, in order to take advantage of market opportunities.

					

The Company also enters into arrangements of securitization of receivables in order to reduce the
impact of interest rate movements. Further, Company also enters into interest rate swap contracts
with banks to manage its interest rate risk.

					

As at March 31, 2025 and 2024 financial liabilities of ₹ 14,992 crores and ₹ 42,719 crores respectively,
were subject to variable interest rates. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the
balance sheet date would result in an impact (decrease/increase of profit before tax) of ₹ 150 crores
and ₹ 427 crores on income for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

						The model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve.
Although some assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, these may
not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of
assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other
types of assets may change with a lag.
					

The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield
curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been
calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not
necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.

					

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

					

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge some of its exposure to interest rate
arising from variable rate foreign currency denominated debt. The Company also uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to convert some of its foreign currency denominated fixed rate debt to floating
rate debt.

				

Equity price risk:

(c)

					

Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities.

					

The fair value of some of the Company’s investments in equity securities exposes the Company to
equity price risks. In general, these securities are not held for trading purposes. These investments are
subject to changes in the market price of securities.

					

The fair value of some of the Company’s investment in quoted equity securities measured at FVOCI as
of March 31, 2025 and 2024, was ₹ 848 crores and ₹ 961 crores, respectively. A 10% change in prices
of these securities held as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, would result in a pre-tax impact of ₹ 85 crores
and ₹ 96 crores on equity, respectively.

			

(ii) Credit Risk

				

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counter-party failure to repay or service debt according to
the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of
deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.

				

Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of investments in
debt instruments, trade receivables, finance receivables, loans and derivative financial instruments. The
Company strives to promptly identify and reduce concerns about collection due to a deterioration in the
financial conditions and others of its main counterparties by regularly monitoring their situation based on
their financial condition.

				

None of the financial instruments of the Company result in material concentrations of credit risks.

				Exposure to credit risk
				

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure
to credit risk was ₹ 1,13,254 crores as at March 31, 2025 and ₹ 1,26,136 crores as at March 31, 2024, being
the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, short term deposits with banks, trade receivables,
finance receivables, margin money and other financial assets excluding equity investments.

				

Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

				

None of the Company’s cash equivalents, including time deposits with banks, are past due or impaired.
Regarding trade receivables and other receivables, and other loans or receivables that are neither impaired
nor past due, there were no indications as at March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, that defaults in payment
obligations will occur.

(iv) Derivative financial instruments and risk management

				

The Company has entered into variety of foreign currency, interest rates and commodity forward contracts
and options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
price risk. The counterparty is generally a bank. These financial exposures are managed in accordance with
the Company’s risk management policies and procedures.

				

The Company also enters into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swap agreements, mainly
to manage exposure on its fixed rate or variable rate debt. The Company uses interest rate derivatives or
currency swaps to hedge exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on principal and interest payments for
borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.

				

Specific transactional risks include risks like liquidity and pricing risks, interest rate and exchange rate
fluctuation risks, volatility risks, counterparty risks, settlement risks and gearing risks.

				

Fair value of derivative financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques based on
information derived from observable market data.

Commodity Price Risk

				

The Company is exposed to commodity price risk arising from the purchase of certain raw materials such as
aluminium, copper, platinum and palladium. This risk is mitigated through the use of derivative contracts and
fixed-price contracts with suppliers. On January 1, 2025, JLR applied hedge accounting to the existing trade
book of aluminium and copper derivative contracts. Hedge accounting is also applied to new aluminium and
copper contracts from the same date. The remaining derivative contracts are not hedge accounted under
Ind AS 109 but are instead measured at fair value through profit or loss.

				

The fair value (gain)/loss on non-hedge accounted commodity derivative contracts, recognized in the
consolidated statement of Profit and Loss was ₹ (162) crores and ₹ 1,531 crores for the years ended March 31,
2025 and 2024, respectively.

				

A 10% appreciation/depreciation in all commodity prices underlying such commodity contracts that are
sensitive to changes in commodity prices would have resulted in the approximate additional (loss)/gain
shown the in the table below:

Independent Auditor’s Report
Basis for Opinion

To the Members of Tata Motors Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of
Tata Motors Limited (the “Company”), its joint operation
(including its subsidiary company) and its Trust which
comprise the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2025,
and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including
other comprehensive income), standalone statement of
changes in equity and standalone statement of cash flows for
the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial
statements, including material accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone
financial statements give the information required by the
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs
of the Company as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and other
comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows
for the year ended on that date.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone
Financial Statements section of our report. We are
independent of the Company in accordance with the Code
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant
to our audit of the standalone financial statements under
the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the
standalone financial statements.

Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
standalone financial statements of the current period. These

opinion on these matters.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

420

decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:




Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the standalone financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.



Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the Management and
Board of Directors.



Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis
of accounting in preparation of standalone financial
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to the related disclosures in the standalone financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.



and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate
with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a
matter should not be communicated in our report because
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory
Requirements

2 A. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that:

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the standalone financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the
Company and such other entities included in the standalone
financial statements of which we are the independent
auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the standalone financial statements of Tata Motors
Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial statements
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of
our report of even date)

Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements of Tata Motors Limited
(“the Company”) and such company incorporated in India
under the Act which is its joint operation company (including
its subsidiary company) as of 31 March 2025 in conjunction
with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the
Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company and its joint operation company
(including its subsidiary company) has, in all material
respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements and such internal financial controls
were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on
the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements criteria established by such companies considering
the essential components of such internal controls stated in
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).

Management’s and Board of Directors’
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The respective company’s Management and the Board of
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining
internal financial controls based on the internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements criteria
established by the respective company considering the
essential components of internal control stated in the
Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal
financial controls that were operating effectively for
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,
including adherence to the respective company’s policies,
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable
financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements. Those Standards
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements were
established and maintained and if such controls operated
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements and their
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements included
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with
Reference to Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements include those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company

430

are being made only in accordance with authorisations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Background and operations

		

Tata Motors Limited referred to as (“the Company”
or “Tata Motors”), designs, manufactures and sells a
wide range of automotive vehicles. The Company also
manufactures engines for industrial applications.
The Company is a public limited Company incorporated
and domiciled in India and has its registered office at
Mumbai, India. As at March 31, 2025, Tata Sons Private
Limited, together with its subsidiaries owns 42.51% of
the Ordinary shares of the Company and has the ability
to significantly influence the Company’s operations.

(c) Use of estimates and judgments
		

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with Ind AS requires management
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions,
that affect the application of accounting policies
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of these financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses for
the periods presented. Actual results may differ
from these estimates and judgements.

		

Estimates

		

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed
at each balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised and future periods affected.

		

In particular, information about significant areas
of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments
in applying accounting policies that have the
most significant effect on the amounts recognised
in the financial statements are included in the
following notes:

		

i)

Note 3 and Note 5 - Property, plant and
equipment and Intangible assets- useful life
and impairment

		

ii)

Note 27 - Provision for product warranty

		

iii)

Note 33(B) - Assets and obligations relating to
employee benefits

The standalone financial statements were approved by
the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May
13, 2025.

2

Material accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance

		

These financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards
(“Ind AS”) as notified under the Companies (Indian
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 read with
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
as amended from time to time.

(b) Basis of preparation
		

These financial statements have been prepared
on historical cost basis except for certain financial
instruments which are measured at fair value at
the end of each reporting period as explained
in the accounting policies below. All amounts
have been rounded to the nearest crores, unless
otherwise indicated. “0” refers to amounts less
than ₹ 0.50 crore.

		

Joint operations :

		

Certain of the Company’s activities, are conducted
through a joint operation, which is a joint
arrangement whereby the parties that have joint
control of the arrangement have rights to the
assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating
to the arrangement. As per Ind AS 111 - Joint
arrangements, in its separate financial statements,
the Company being a joint operator has recognised
its share of the assets, liabilities, income and
expenses of these joint operations incurred jointly
with the other partners, along with its share of
income from the sale of the output and any assets,
liabilities and expenses that it has incurred in
relation to the joint operation.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Although not required by Ind AS, the Company has
provided in note 47 additional information of Tata
Motors Limited on a standalone basis excluding its
interest in its Joint Operation viz. Tata Cummins
Private Limited (including its subsidiary company).

		Judgements
		

i)

Revenue recognition: The Company uses
judgement to determine when control of its
goods, primarily vehicles and parts, pass to
the customer. This is assessed with reference
to indicators of control, including the risks
and rewards of ownership and legal title
with reference to the underlying terms of
the customer contract. Refer to note 31 for
further information.

		

ii)

Capitalisation of product engineering
costs: The Company applies judgement
in determining at what point in a vehicle
programme’s life cycle the recognition

Notes forming part of Financial Statements
criteria under Ind AS 38 are satisfied, and in
determining the nature of the cost capitalised.
Refer to note 5 for further information.

(the ‘Going Concern Assessment Period’ and the
‘Foreseeable Future’).
		

In developing these forecasts, the Company has
modelled a base case, which has been further
sensitised using severe but plausible downside
scenarios. It also accounts for other end-market
and operational factors throughout the Going
Concern Assessment Period. This has been further
sensitized using more severe but plausible scenarios
considering external market commentaries and
other factors impacting the global economy and
automotive industry. Management do not consider
more extreme scenarios than the ones assessed to
be plausible.

		

In evaluating the forecasts, the Company has
taken into consideration both the sufficiency of
liquidity to meet obligations as they fall due as well
as potential impact on compliance with financial
covenants during the forecast period. These
forecasts indicate that, based on cash generated
from operations, the existing funding facilities and
inter corporate deposits from subsidiaries, the
Company will have sufficient liquidity to operate
and discharge its liabilities as they become due,
without breaching any relevant covenants and the
need for any mitigating actions.

		

Based on the evaluation described above,
management believes that the Company has
sufficient financial resources available to it at the
date of approval of these financial statements and
that it will be able to continue as a ‘going concern’
in the foreseeable future and for a period up to
September 30, 2026.

(d) Cost recognition
		

Costs and expenses are recognised when incurred
and are classified according to their nature.
Expenditure are capitalized where appropriate, in
accordance with the policy for internally generated
intangible assets and represents employee costs,
stores and other manufacturing supplies, and other
expenses incurred for construction and product
development undertaken by the Company.

		

Material and other cost of sales as reported in the
statement of profit and loss is presented net of
the impact of realised foreign exchange relating to
derivatives hedging cost exposures.

(e) Segments
		

The Company primarily operates in the automotive
business and has a single segment of commercial
vehicles. The Company has opted for an exemption
as per para 4 of Ind AS 108. Segment information is
thus given in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company.

(f) Foreign currency
		

These financial statements are presented in Indian
rupees, which is the functional currency of Tata
Motors Limited.

		

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of
transaction. Foreign currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured
into the functional currency at the exchange rate
prevailing on the balance sheet date.

		

		

At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses
whether there is any indication that any property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets with
finite lives may be impaired. If any such impairment
exists the recoverable amount of an asset is
estimated to determine the extent of impairment,
if any. Where it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
Company estimates the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

		

Intangible assets not yet available for use, are
tested for impairment annually at each balance
sheet date, or earlier, if there is an indication that
the asset may be impaired.

		

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in

Exchange differences arising on settlement of
transactions and translation of monetary items
are recognized in the statement of Profit or Loss
except to the extent, exchange differences which
are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs
on foreign currency borrowings, are capitalized as
part of borrowing costs.

(g) Going concern
		

The Company’s financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis.

		

The Company has performed an assessment of
its financial position as at March 31, 2025 and
forecasts of the Company for a period of eighteen
months from the date of these financial statements

use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset for which the estimates of future cash flows
have not been adjusted.
		

		

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in the statement of Profit
and Loss.
An asset or cash-generating unit impaired in prior
years is reviewed at each balance sheet date
to determine whether there is any indication
of a reversal of impairment loss recognized in
prior years.

(i) Recent accounting pronouncements
		

		

3

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new
standards or amendments to the existing standards
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Rules as issued from time to time. During the year
ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS
117 - Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind
As 116 – Leases, relating to sale and lease back
transactions, applicable from April 1, 2024. The
Company has assessed that there is no significant
impact on its financial statements.
On May 9, 2025, MCA notifies the amendments to
Ind AS 21 - Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange
Rates. These amendments aim to provide clearer
guidance on assessing currency exchangeability
and estimating exchange rates when currencies
are not readily exchangeable. The amendments are
effective for annual periods beginning on or after
April 1, 2025. The Company is currently assessing
the probable impact of these amendments on its
financial statements.

Property, plant and equipment

(a) Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
of acquisition or construction less accumulated
depreciation and impairment, if any.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

Freehold land is measured at cost and is not depreciated.
Cost includes purchase price, non-recoverable taxes
and duties, labour cost and direct overheads for selfconstructed assets and other direct costs incurred up to
the date the asset is ready for its intended use.
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and
equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that
future economic benefits associated with these will flow
to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are recognized
in the statement of profit and loss when incurred.
Interest cost incurred is capitalised up to the date the
asset is ready for its intended use for qualifying assets,
based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing
the asset or the weighted average rate of all other
borrowings, if no specific borrowings have been incurred
for the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the Straight Line Method
(SLM) over the estimated useful lives of the assets
considering the nature, estimated usage, operating
conditions, past history of replacement, anticipated
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties
and maintenance support. Taking into account these
factors, the Company has decided to retain the useful
life hitherto adopted for various categories of property,
plant and equipments, which are different from those
prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
Estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Type of Asset

Estimated useful life
(years)

Buildings, Roads, Bridge and culverts

4 to 60 years

Plant, machinery and equipment

8 to 20 years

Computers and other IT assets

4 to 6 years

Vehicles

4 to 10 years

Furnitures, fixtures and office equipment

5 to 15 years

The useful lives are reviewed at each year end. Changes
in expected useful lives are treated as change in
accounting estimates.
Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress
until construction and installation are complete and the
asset is ready for its intended use.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized
on disposal. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition
of an item of property, plant and equipment is included
in the statement of profit and loss.

Assets classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than
through continuing use. Such assets are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs
to sell. Once classified as held-for-sale, property, plant and equipment are no longer depreciated. The Company has stated

Leases
(a) Accounting policy

		Lessee:
		

At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is, or contains,
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company
assesses whether:

		

•

The contract involves the use of an identified asset –this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be
physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a
substantive substation right, then the asset is not identified;

		

•

The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the
period of use; and

		

•

The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision
making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purposes the asset is used. In rare cases
where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company has the
right to direct the use of the asset if either:

		

•

The Company has the right to operate the asset; or

		

•

The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used.

		

As a practical expedient, accounting standards permit a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead
account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this
practical expedient. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company
allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.

		

The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated dilapidation
costs, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of the leased asset
is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease
payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset.

		

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s
incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is
re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments.

		

Lease payments include fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable
under a residual value guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to
exercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that
the Company shall exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right of use asset which comprises
of amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated
dilapidation costs.

		

Payment made towards short term leases (leases for which non-cancellable term is 12 months or lesser) and low
value assets (lease of assets worth less than ₹0.03 crores) are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss as rental
expenses over the tenor of such leases.										

		Lessor:
		

443

At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based
on contractual terms and substance of the lease arrangement. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are
classified as operating leases.

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net
investment in the leases. Finance income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of
return on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

		

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.				

(b) The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which
have a renewal and/or purchase option in the normal course of the business. Extension and termination options
are included in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are
exercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether
it is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within
its control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will
continue to be monitored by the Company where relevant. The Company’s leases mature between 2026 and 2037.
The weighted average rate applied is 8.37% (2024: 8.57%).

Other Intangible assets
(a) Accounting policy

		

Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost or fair value as on the date of acquisition less accumulated
amortisation and impairment, if any.

		

Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as per details below:
Estimated amortisation
period

Technical know-how

8 to 10 years

Software

4 years

Product development cost

2 to 10 years

		The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at each year-end. Changes in expected
useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

		

Internally generated intangible asset

		

Research costs are charged to the statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they are incurred.

		

Product development costs incurred on new vehicle platform, engines, transmission and new products are recognised
as intangible assets, when feasibility has been established, the Company has committed technical, financial and other
resources to complete the development and it is probable that asset will generate future economic benefits.

		

The cost of an internally generated intangible asset is the sum of directly attributable expenditure incurred from the
date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria to the completion of its development.

		

Interest cost incurred is capitalised up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use for qualifying assets, based
on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings if no
specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.

		

Product development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any.
Amortisation is not recorded on product engineering in progress until development is complete.

		

Derecognition of intangible assets

		

An item of intangible assets is derecognized on disposal or when fully amortized and no longer in use. Any gain or loss
arising from derecognition of an item of intangible assets is included in the statement of profit and loss.

(b) Intangible assets consist of the following:

Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to shares :

		

•

In respect of every Ordinary share of ₹2 each (whether fully or partly paid), voting rights shall be in the same
proportion as the capital paid up on such Ordinary share bears to the total paid up Ordinary share capital of
the Company.

		

•

The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to the approval of the shareholders in the ensuing
Annual General Meeting.		

		

•

In the event of liquidation, the shareholders are eligible to receive the remaining assets of the Company after
distribution of all preferential amounts, in proportion to their shareholdings.

		

•

The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the
regulatory and other approvals including from the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”)) a Scheme
of Arrangement (“Scheme”) for reduction, through cancellation of the entire ‘A’ Ordinary Share capital
and in consideration thereof, issue and allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the Company, in the manner as
contemplated in the Scheme.

			

The Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September
1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’ Ordinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crores) and
issued and allotted 35,59,52,028 New Ordinary Shares of ₹2.00 each (₹71 crores) to TML Securities Trust, in
terms of the Scheme. The resultant difference of ₹31 crores is recorded in Securities Premium Account. TML
Securities Trust was able to credit New ordinary Shares to the respective ‘A’ Ordinary shareholders, except
173,389 New Ordinary Shares. Of these 86,411 new Ordinary Shares, have been transferred to Investor Education
and Protection Fund on March 13, 2025. Remaining 86,978 new Ordinary Shares, yet to be transferred to the
ultimate shareholders/beneficial owners by TML Securities Trust as on March 31, 2025, are consolidated in the
standalone financial statements. These 86,978 new Ordinary Shares are presently held in an escrow demat
account of the Company.

			

The total expenses of ₹70 crores (including ₹53 crores for the year ended March 31, 2025) incurred on the
cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares have been accounted through retained earnings.

			

The issue of new Ordinary Shares as consideration for reduction by way of cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares,
was considered to be ‘Deemed Dividend’ in the hands of ‘A’ Ordinary Shareholders in terms of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. The TDS liability of the Company on the aforesaid ‘Deemed Dividend’, amounting to ₹1,073 crores,
has been funded through sale of requisite number of new Ordinary Shares, in the manner as contemplated in
the Scheme.

b) Debenture redemption reserve (DRR)

			

		

Capital redemption reserve
The Indian Companies Act, 2013 (the “Companies Act”) requires that where a company purchases its own shares
out of free reserves or securities premium account, a sum equal to the nominal value of the shares so purchased
shall be transferred to a capital redemption reserve account and details of such transfer shall be disclosed in the
balance sheet. The capital redemption reserve account may be applied by the Company, in paying up unissued
shares of the company to be issued to shareholders of the company as fully paid bonus shares. Tata Motors
Limited established this reserve pursuant to the redemption of preference shares issued in earlier years.

The Companies Act requires that where a company issues debentures, it shall create a debenture redemption
reserve out of profits of the Company available for payment of dividend. The company is required to maintain
a Debenture Redemption Reserve of 25% of the value of debentures issued, either by a public issue or on a
private placement basis. The amounts credited to the debenture redemption reserve may not be utilised by the
Company except to redeem debentures. Transfers represent DRR on debentures issued before August 16, 2019
and pertaining to debentures repaid during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. No DRR is required for

27 Provisions
(a) Accounting policy
		

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the liability.

		

Product warranty expenses

		

The estimated liability for product warranties is recognised when products are sold or when new warranty programmes
are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost
of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future warranty claims, customer goodwill and
recall complaints. The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being typically up to
six years. The Company also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle
fault is proven to be a supplier’s fault.

		

The Company’s calculation methodology uses detailed historical data corrected for experience as information becomes
available as well as individual campaign assumptions (such as scope, uptake rates and repair costs). The calculated
provisions are compared to current spend rates to assess balances versus expected future obligations. This can lead
to changes in the carrying value of provisions as assumptions are updated over the life of each warranty to reflect
where actual experience differs to past experience, for example due to higher inflation or timing of claims impacting

disbursement curve analysis. However, there are no individual assumptions that can be reasonably expected to move
over the next financial year to such a degree that it would result in a material adjustment to the warranty provision.
		

The Company notes that changes in the automotive environment presents its own significant challenges, particularly
due to the lack of maturity and historical data available at this time to help inform estimates for future warranty
claims, as well as any associated recoveries from suppliers due to such claims. The related provisions are made with
the Company’s best estimate at this time to settle such obligations in the future but will be required to be continually
refined as sufficient, real-world data becomes available.

		

The discount on the warranty provision is calculated using a risk-free discount rate as the risks specific to the liability,
such as inflation, are included in the base calculation.

		

Estimates of the future costs of warranty actions are subject to numerous uncertainties, including the enactment
of new laws and regulations, the number of vehicles affected by a service or recall action and the nature or final
cost of the corrective action. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the inputs to these assumptions, it is
reasonably possible that the actual cost expenditure over an extended period of time could be materially different to
the estimate in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated.

		

Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier,
adjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on Balance Sheet date. Supplier
reimbursements are recognised as separate asset “Recoverable from Suppliers” under Other financial assets. (Refer
Notes 11 and 12).

28 Income taxes
(a) Accounting policy
		Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of
Profit and Loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit and loss (whether in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit and loss. Current
income taxes are determined based on respective taxable income of each taxable entity.
		

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation
carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable
entity. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable income will be available
against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax
credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset
to be recovered.

		

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on
a net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards can be utilised.

		

Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from interests in joint operation are not recognised
if the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme. Under such scheme, the Company is committed to export prescribed times
of the duty saved on import of capital goods over a specified period of time. In case such commitments are not met,
the Company would be required to pay the duty saved along with interest to the regulatory authorities.

31 Revenue recognition
(a) Accounting policy
		

The Company generates revenue principally from-

		

i)

Sale of products - commercial vehicles and vehicle parts.

			

The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of
variable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products
are delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks
and rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably
assured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of
variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the
contract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis.

			

The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary
depending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for
as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue
recognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the expected
sales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and
local market conditions.

			

The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are
recognised net of their costs within revenues in the income statement.

		

Sale of services - maintenance service and extended warranties for commercial vehicles.

ii)

			

Income from sale of maintenance services and extended warranties are recognised as income over the relevant
period of service or extended warranty.

			

When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty,
such services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is in excess of the
standard offerings to the customer. In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance
service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract
liability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold
separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary
method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company
estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on
similar services.

2024-25

Notes forming part of Financial Statements
			

The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points
on the spend towards Company’s products. The reward points earned by customers can be redeemed to claim
discounts on future purchase of certain products or services. Transaction price allocated towards reward points
granted to customers is recognised as a deferred income liability and transferred to income when customers
redeem their reward points.

			

Sales of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time. Any amount
received in advance in respect of such performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time is recorded
as a contract liability and recorded as revenue when service is rendered to customers.

			

Refund liabilities comprise of obligation towards customers to pay for discounts and sales incentives.

32 Other income
(a) Accounting policy
		Government Grants and Incentives
		

469

Other income includes export and other recurring and non-recurring incentives from Government (referred as
“incentives”). Government grants are recognised when there is a reasonable assurance that the Company will comply
with the relevant conditions and the grant will be received. Government grants are recognised in the statement
of profit and loss, either on a systematic basis when the Company recognises, as expenses, the related costs that
the grants are intended to compensate or, immediately if the costs have already been incurred. Government grants
related to assets are deferred and amortised over the useful life of the asset. Government grants related to income
are presented as an offset against the related expenditure, and government grants that are awarded as incentives
with no ongoing performance obligations to the Company are recognised as income in the period in which the grant
is received.

(B) Employee benefits
		

(a) Accounting policy

			(i)

Gratuity

				

Tata Motors Limited and its Joint operation have an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement
plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lump-sum payment to vested employees at
retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to
30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of
service. Tata Motors Limited makes annual contributions to gratuity funds established as trusts. Tata Motors
Limited account for the liability for gratuity benefits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.

			

(ii) Bhavishya kalyan yojana (BKY)

				

			

Bhavishya Kalyan Yojana is an unfunded defined benefit plan for employees of Tata Motors Limited. The
benefits of the plan include pension in certain cases, payable up to the date of normal superannuation had
the employee been in service, to an eligible employee at the time of death or permanent disablement, while
in service, either as a result of an injury or as certified by the appropriate authority. The monthly payment
to dependents of the deceased/disabled employee under the plan equals 50% of the salary drawn at the
time of death or accident or a specified amount, whichever is greater. Tata Motors Limited account for the
liability for BKY benefits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.

(iii) Provident fund and family pension

				

In accordance with Indian law, eligible employees of Tata Motors Limited and joint operations are entitled
to receive benefits in respect of provident fund, a defined contribution plan, in which both employees
and the Company make monthly contributions at a specified percentage of the covered employees’ salary
(currently 12% of employees’ salary). The contributions, as specified under the law, were made to the
provident fund and pension fund set up as an irrevocable trust or to respective Regional Provident Fund
Commissioner and the Central Provident Fund under the State Pension scheme. The interest rate, payable
to the members of the trust, was not to be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by the Central
Government under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall,
if any, was made good by the Company. The embedded interest rate guarantee is considered to be defined
benefit for the joint operation as Provident Fund is managed by trust.

(iv) Post-retirement medicare scheme

				

Under this unfunded scheme, employees of Tata Motors Limited receive medical benefits subject to certain
limits on amounts of benefits, periods after retirement and types of benefits, depending on their grade and
location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company as part of an Early Separation
Scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. Tata
Motors Limited account for the liability for post-retirement medical scheme based on an actuarial valuation.

			(v)

Compensated absences

				

The Company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees
are entitled to accumulate leave subject to certain limits, for future encashment. The liability is provided
based on the number of days of unutilised leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent
actuarial valuation.

			

(vi) Remeasurement gains and losses

				

Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on assets
(excluding interest) relating to retirement benefit plans, are recognised directly in other comprehensive
income in the period in which they arise. Remeasurement recorded in other comprehensive income is not
reclassified to statement of Profit and Loss.

				

Actuarial gains and losses relating to long-term employee benefits are recognised in the statement of Profit
and Loss in the period in which they arise.

			(vii) Measurement date
				

The measurement date of retirement plans is March 31.

				

The present value of the defined benefit liability and the related current service cost and past service cost
are measured using projected unit credit method.

				

The present value of the post-employment benefit obligations depends on a number of factors, it is
determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the
net cost/(income) for pensions include the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions. Any changes
in these assumptions will impact upon the carrying amount of post-employment benefit obligations. Key
assumptions and sensitivities for post employment benefit obligations are disclosed in note below.

The Company’s policy is driven by considerations of maximising returns while ensuring credit quality of the
debt instruments. The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on investment criteria prescribed
under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, and is also subject to other exposure limitations. The Company evaluates
the risks, transaction costs and liquidity for potential investments. To measure plan asset performance, the
Company compares actual returns for each asset category with published bench marks.

			

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at March 31, 2025 is 10.14 years (March 31,
2024 : 9.74 years).

			

The Company expects to contribute ₹11 crores to the funded pension plans in the year ending March 31, 2026.

Tata Motors Limited (the “Company”) in October 2019 had by way of an application, addressed to the Employee
Provident Fund Organization (“EPFO”), offered to surrender its exempted Pension fund. Subsequently, the Company
incurred losses for three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic
cancellation/ withdrawal of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court ruled that
those who were members of a statutory pension fund as on September 1, 2014, can exercise a joint option with their
employer to contribute to their Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw a higher pension
calculated based on last 5 years average salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its
employees for joint option to contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal.

		

As per the actuarial valuation, an additional provision of ₹165 crores have been made for pension on higher salary
during the year ended March 31, 2025. EPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s
Pension Trust. Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the conclusion of
the surrender process of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon’ble Delhi High Court (“Court”)
for seeking directions to EPFO to immediately start administering TML’s Pension Fund. The trade unions have also
filed another Writ Petition for expediting the transfer of pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of
the employees.

(ii)

EPFO in December 2024, sent a recommendation to the Government of India for cancellation of the Company’s
pension exemption, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions. The parties had series of meetings to channelize the
migration of members data to EPFO’s unified portal, prominently the joint meetings in April 2025, of which the duly
signed minutes were filed in the Court on May 1, 2025. It has been agreed in the said minutes that EPFO will provide a
facility on the Unified Portal for the Company to migrate the members’ data on EPFO’s portal. The Company will start
contribution in statutory pension fund w.e.f. wage month of July 2025. Pension Trust will transfer the liability towards
normal pension valuation carried by EPFO. The Court took the above minutes on its records and fixed the matter on
July 23, 2025 for implementation of same as per timelines agreed in the minutes.
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company partially sold its stake (21.3%) represented by 8,64,36,184
equity shares in Tata Technologies Limited (TTL) for total consideration of ₹3,812 crores, which resulted in profit of
₹ 3,748 crores.

39 Commitments and contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, the Company faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Company assesses
such claims and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an ongoing basis, with the assistance of external legal
counsel, wherever necessary. The Company records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable
of being estimated and discloses such matters in its financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered
possible, but not probable, the Company provides disclosure in the financial statements but does not record a liability in its
accounts unless the loss becomes probable.
The following is a description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is possible, but not probable. The Company
believes that none of the contingencies described below would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. Also, the below amount excludes consequential interest and penalty, if any.

Litigation
The Company is involved in legal proceedings, both as plaintiff and as defendant. There are claims which the Company does
not believe to be of material nature, other than those described below.

Income Tax
The Company has ongoing disputes with income tax authorities relating to tax treatment of certain items. These mainly
include disallowed expenses, the tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by the Company as deductions and the
computation of, or eligibility of, the Company’s use of certain tax incentives or allowances.
Most of these disputes and/or disallowances, being repetitive in nature, have been raised by the income tax authorities
consistently in most of the years.
The Company has a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), or CIT (A), the Dispute Resolution Panel,
or DRP, and to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, or ITAT, against adverse decisions by the assessing officer, DRP or CIT (A),
as applicable. The income tax authorities have similar rights of appeal to the ITAT against adverse decisions by the CIT (A)
or DRP. The Company has a further right of appeal to the Bombay High Court or the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against
adverse decisions by the appellate authorities for matters involving substantial question of law. The income tax authorities
have similar rights of appeal.
As at March 31, 2025, there are contingent liabilities towards matters and/or disputes pending in appeal amounting to
₹174 crores (₹164 crores as at March 31, 2024).

Customs, Excise Duty and Service Tax
As at March 31, 2025, there are pending litigation for various matters relating to customs, excise duty and service taxes
involving demands, including interest and penalties, of ₹409 crores (₹348 crores as at March 31, 2024). These demands

Sales Tax/VAT
The total sales tax demands (including interest and penalty), that are being contested by the Company amount to ₹437
crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹847 crores as at March 31, 2024). The details of the demands for more than ₹100 crores are
as follows:
The Sales Tax Authorities have raised demand of ₹123 crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹227 crores as at March 31, 2024)
towards rejection of certain statutory forms for concessional lower/nil tax rate on technical grounds and few other issues
such as late submission, single form issued against different months / quarters dispatches / sales, etc. and denial of
exemption from tax in absence of proof of export for certain years. The Company has contended that the benefit cannot
be denied on technicalities, which are being complied with. The matter is pending at various levels.
The Sales Tax authorities have denied input tax credit and levied interest and penalty thereon due to varied reasons
aggregating to ₹196 crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹250 crores as at March 31, 2024). The reasons for disallowing credit
was mainly due to Taxes not paid by Vendors, incorrect method of calculation of set off as per the department, alleging
suppression of sales as per the department etc. The matter is contested in appeal.

Other Taxes and Dues
Other amounts for which the Company may contingently be liable aggregate to ₹715 crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹637
crores as at March 31, 2024). Following are the cases involving more than ₹100 crores.
As at March 31, 2025, property tax amounting to ₹176 crores (₹169 crores as at March 31, 2024) has been demanded by
the local municipal authorities in respect of vacant land of the Company in the plant in Pimpri (including residential land),
Chinchwad and Chikhali. The Company had filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India
against an unfavorable decision of the Bombay High Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had disposed of the SLP
and remanded the matter back to the local municipal corporation for fresh adjudication. After fresh hearing, the municipal
authority again passed the same order as it had passed earlier, which the Company has challenged before the Civil Court.
The Civil Court has passed an injunction order restraining the municipal authority from taking any action of recovery.
As at March 31, 2025, the Company has contingent liability of ₹416 crores (₹ 340 crores as at March 31, 2024) towards
Temporary Registration Fee and short payment of Road Tax to the office of District Transport Officer, Government of
Jharkhand basis demand for earlier years. The Company believes it has a good case on merits to contest the matter and
hence it has been disclosed as contingent liability.

Other claims
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”) by their order dated February 28, 2019, set out the principles based on which
allowances paid to the employees should be identified for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes of computation of
Provident Fund contribution. There are interpretative challenges and considerable uncertainty, including estimating the
amount retrospectively. Pending the directions from the EPFO, the impact for past periods, if any, is not ascertainable
reliably and consequently no financial effect has been provided for in the financial statements. The Company has complied
with this on a prospective basis, from the date of the SC order. Also refer note 38(i) for pension.

Commitments
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company has acquired 26.79% stake in Freight Commerce Solutions Private
Limited (Freight Tiger) for a consideration of ₹150 crores. Freight Tiger is a digital platform that provides end-to-end
logistics value chain solutions for cargo movement in the country. The Securities Subscription Agreement (SSA) signed with
Freight Tiger also includes a provision enabling the Company to further invest ₹100 crores over the next two years, at the
then prevailing market value.
The Company has entered into various contracts with vendors and contractors for the acquisition of plant and machinery,
equipment and various civil contracts of a capital nature amounting to ₹770 crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹590 crores
as at March 31, 2024), which are yet to be executed. The Company has entered into various contracts with vendors and
contractors for the acquisition of intangible assets of a capital nature amounting to ₹128 crores as at March 31, 2025
(₹82 crores as at March 31, 2024), which are yet to be executed.

42 Financial instruments
(a) Accounting policy
		

i)

Recognition:

			

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or
equity instrument of another entity.

			

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial
instruments are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument.

			

Initial measurement

			

Financial instruments are initially recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not
classified as at fair value through profit or loss. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant
financing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at fair
value through profit or loss are expensed in the statement of profit and loss.

			

Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified.

			

Classification and measurement – financial assets

			

Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the
characteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and
past pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when
determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. The Company reclassifies
financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

			

Financial assets are classified into three categories

			Financial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates
to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held
within a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows
are classified in this category. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method less any impairment losses.
			Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Equity instruments): These include
financial assets that are equity instruments and are designated as such upon initial recognition irrevocably.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

484

Notes forming part of Financial Statements
Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other comprehensive
income, net of applicable income taxes.
			

Dividends from these equity investments are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss when the right to
receive payment has been established. When the equity investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss
in equity is transferred to retained earnings.

		

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Debt instruments): Financial assets having
contractual terms that give rise on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal outstanding and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold such
assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial asset, are classified in this
category. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses being recognised in
other comprehensive income apart from any expected credit losses or foreign exchange gains or losses, which
are recognised in profit or loss.

			Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit
and loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair
value through profit and loss are immediately recognised in profit and loss.
			Classification and measurement – financial liabilities:
			

			
			

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as
at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense,
are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or
loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.
Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured
at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognised less, the cumulative
amount of income recognised.
Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

			Equity instruments:
			

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Company after
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received,
net of direct issue costs.

		

Determination of fair value:

ii)

			

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using another valuation technique.

			

The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the
consideration given or received).

			

In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset
or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability
at the measurement date.

			

Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted
in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities
held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow
method and other valuation methods.

		

iii) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities:

			

485

The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to

another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an
associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also
recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is
recognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity
is transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value
through other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained
earnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company
reviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities.
			

		

Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged,
cancelled or has expired.

iv) Impairment of financial assets:

			

The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a financial asset that is at amortised
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are forward looking and are
measured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time
value of money (values are discounted using the applicable effective interest rate) and uses reasonable and
supportable information.

		

Hedge accounting:

v)

			

			

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency
fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts
in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses interest
rate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e.
when interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates.
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair
value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.

			

At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are
expected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value
of foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates amounts excluding foreign
currency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency
interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts that are designated and effective as
hedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income
(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

			

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of Profit and Loss or Balance Sheet in the
periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs.

			

For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are
treated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other
comprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge.
Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate
risk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income.

			
			

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of
profit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an adjustment to a nonfinancial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These deferred amounts are

ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example through cost of goods
sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is
retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is
immediately transferred to the statement of Profit and Loss for the year.

			Fair Value Hierarchy
			

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below.

			

Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are
measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This
category consists of quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments.

			

Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and
liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e; as prices) or indirectly (i.e; derived from prices). This level of hierarchy include
Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.

			

Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial
assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither
supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on
available market data.

Notes forming part of Financial Statements
			

There has been no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 for the years ended March 31, 2025 and
2024 respectively.

			

The investments in certain unquoted equity instruments which are held for medium or long-term strategic
purpose and are not held for trading. Upon the application of Ind AS 109, the Company has chosen to designate
these investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI as the management believe that this provides a more
meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value in
profit or loss.

			

Derivatives are fair valued using market observable rates and published prices together with forecast cash flow
information where applicable.

Other short-term financial assets and liabilities are stated at amortised cost which is approximately equal to their
fair value.

			

The fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price
and for other borrowings the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows, using a discount
rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return, adjusted for the credit spread considered by the lenders for
instruments of similar maturity.

			

Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However, there are
inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, substantially for all financial instruments, the fair
value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have
realised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates. As such, the fair value of the financial instruments
subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different from the amounts reported at each period end.

		

(b) Offsetting :

			

Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are subject to offsetting where there is currently a legally
enforceable right to set off recognised amounts and the Company intends to either settle on a net basis, or to
realise the asset and settle the liability, simultaneously.

			

Certain derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are subject to master netting arrangements, whereby
in the case of insolvency, derivative financial assets and financial liabilities will be settled on a net basis.

(c) Financial risk management :

			

In the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its
financial instruments.

			

The Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks
associated with the financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management
policy is approved by the board of directors. The risk management framework aims to:

			

•	Create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate
fluctuations on the Company’s business plan.

			

•	Achieve greater predictability to earnings by determining the financial value of the expected earnings
in advance.

			(i)

Market risk

				Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may
result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change
as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price fluctuations,
liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with
reasonable accuracy.
				(a)

Foreign currency exchange rate risk:

					The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the income statement,
statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and statement
of cash flows where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
					Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations
are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily
relate to fluctuations in U.S. dollar, Euro and GBP against the respective functional currencies of
the Company.
					The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments
primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional
currency may impact the Company’s cost of exports and cost of borrowings and consequently may
increase the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.

The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to
exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance
with its risk management policies.

				

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated for each currency by aggregation of the net foreign
exchange rate exposure of each currency and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift in the
foreign exchange rates of each currency by 10% while keeping the other variables as constant.

				

The exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the
Company as disclosed in (iv) derivative financial instruments and risk management below.

(Note: The impact is indicated on the profit before tax.)

		

(b) Interest rate risk

			Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will lead to changes in fair value of financial
instruments or changes in interest income, expense and cash flows of the Company.
			

The Company is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The Company’s
interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations. The Company also uses a mix of interest rate
sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its day to day operations like
short term loans.

			

As at March 31, 2025 and 2024, financial liabilities of ₹1,175 crores and ₹3,783 crores, respectively, were subject
to variable interest rates. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would
result in decrease/increase in profit before tax of ₹12 crores and ₹38 crores for the year ended March 31, 2025
and 2024, respectively.

80th Integrated Annual Report
2024-25

492

Notes forming part of Financial Statements
			

The model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve. Although some
assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, these may not react correspondingly
to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate
with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets may change with a lag.

			

The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This
calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk
exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average
debt outstanding during the period.

			

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

			

(Note: The impact is indicated on the profit before tax.)

		

(c) Equity Price risk

			

Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities..

			

The fair value of some of the Company’s investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income exposes the Company to equity price risks. These investments are subject to changes in the market price
of securities. The fair value of Company’s investment in quoted equity securities as of March 31, 2025 and 2024
was ₹848 crores and ₹856 crores, respectively. A 10% change in equity price as of March 31, 2025 and 2024
would result in a pre- tax impact of ₹85 crores and ₹86 crores, respectively.

			

(Note: The impact is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any).

		(ii) Credit risk
			

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to
the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of
deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.

			

Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of investments classified
as fair value through profit and loss, trade receivables, loans and derivative financial instruments. The Company
strives to promptly identify and reduce concerns about collection due to a deterioration in the financial conditions
and others of its main counterparties by regularly monitoring their situation based on their financial condition.
None of the financial instruments of the Company result in material concentrations of credit risks.

to credit risk was ₹13,395 crores and ₹13,378 crores as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, being the
total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, short term deposits with banks, trade receivables, finance
receivables, margin money and other financial assets excluding equity investments.

			

Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

			

None of the Company’s cash equivalents, including short term deposits with banks, are past due or impaired.
Regarding trade receivables and other receivables, and other loans or receivables that are neither impaired
nor past due, there were no indications as at March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, that defaults in payment
obligations will occur.

		(iv) Derivative financial instruments and risk management
			

The Company has entered into a variety of foreign currency, interest rates and commodity forward contracts
and options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
price risk. The counterparty is generally a bank. These financial exposures are managed in accordance with the
Company’s risk management policies and procedures.

			

The Company also enters into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swap agreements, mainly to
manage exposure on its fixed rate or variable rate debt. The Company uses interest rate derivatives or currency
swaps to hedge exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on principal and interest payments for borrowings
denominated in foreign currencies. In all cases the Company uses a hedge ratio of 1:1.

			

Specific transactional risks include risks like liquidity and pricing risks, interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation
risks, volatility risks, counterparty risks, settlement risks and gearing risks.

			

Fair value of derivative financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques based on information
derived from observable market data.

			

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is as follows:

aluminium, copper, platinum and palladium. This risk is mitigated through the use of derivative contracts and
fixed-price contracts with suppliers. The derivative contracts are not hedge accounted under Ind AS 109 but are

*Construction and demolition waste for FY24 has been restated due to enhanced coverage of waste generation points. Non-hazardous waste for FY24 does
not include plastic waste and scrap disposal that were recorded in lots or numbers.
**Non-hazardous waste disposed in lots have been converted into Metric tonnes using an average conversion factor from the generated value in FY 25 due to
an improvement in tracking processes leading to a marginal increase in the waste footprint reported. Non-hazardous waste includes ferrous and non-ferrous
metal and other scrap like packaging waste, plastic, rubber, glass and auto components that were sold to scrap dealers and not to the primary recyclers.
Recycling data has been certified through declarations by scrap dealers who in turn sell to end-users who are secondary metallurgical industries or recyclers
that convert scrap into other products.
