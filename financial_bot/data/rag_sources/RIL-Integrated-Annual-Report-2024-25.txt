CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT

What is Good for India
is Good for Reliance

More importantly, India is no longer
just following trends — it is setting
them. From UPI’s global success to the
India AI Mission, from green energy to
space tech, India is shaping the future.
This is India’s moment. And Reliance
is proud to walk shoulder-to-shoulder
with the nation — as a committed
partner, a responsible value-creator,
and a technology-driven enabler of
inclusive growth.

Dear Shareholders,

Strong and Resilient Performance
Even amidst external volatility, Reliance
delivered a year of solid and balanced
growth. Our results speak to the
strength of our diversified model and our
deep-rooted execution discipline:

Nearly fifty years ago, our visionary
founder, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani,
embarked on a bold mission —
to prove that India could build a
world-class enterprise founded on
innovation, integrity, and ambition.
That belief became Reliance. And
over the decades, Reliance has
grown from an idea into one of the
world’s most admired enterprises —
a symbol of India’s entrepreneurial
spirit and its limitless potential.

• Revenue: J 10,71,174 crore (+7.1% Y-o-Y)
• EBITDA: J 1,83,422 crore (+2.9% Y-o-Y)
• Net Profit: J 81,309 crore (+2.9% Y-o-Y)
Each business played a vital role in
this performance:
• Retail: Crossed J 3,30,000 crore in
turnover and expanded its footprint
to 19,340 stores, strengthening its
leadership in Indian Retail industry.
• Digital Services: Jio emerged as the
world’s largest data network with 488
million users, including 191 million
on 5G.
• Media: Built a large and distinctive
media institution, in partnership
with Disney, across genres, marking

Shri. Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director,
Reliance Industries Limited

Today, Reliance is not just a company.
It is a national institution that powers
opportunity, progress, and prosperity
for 1.45 billion Indians. Our journey has
been extraordinary — transforming
traditional industries, building globalscale capabilities, creating entirely new
markets, and touching the everyday
lives of our fellow citizens. But we have
never paused to celebrate the past.
Instead, each milestone has inspired
us to aim higher, work harder, and lead
with purpose.

Adapting Boldly, Evolving
Relentlessly
The world is changing at breakneck
speed — reshaped by digital disruption,
global shifts, and technological

breakthroughs. At Reliance, we see this
not as a challenge but as an opportunity.
We are reimagining our future and
reshaping our businesses to become
a new-age deep-tech enterprise.
From energy to entertainment,
from retail to digital services, we are
integrating next-generation technologies
across every business vertical. Over
1,000 of our in-house scientists are
leading cutting-edge research in areas
like AI, renewable energy, advanced
materials, and digital platforms.
Our manufacturing infrastructure
is being future-proofed to support
India’s aspiration to become a
global manufacturing powerhouse.
This evolution mirrors the journey of our

great nation as it steps confidently into
the Amrit Kaal — a transformative era on
the path to becoming a fully developed
‘Viksit Bharat.’

India’s Moment. Reliance’s Resolve.
Today, India is standing tall on the global
stage. Despite global uncertainties and
geopolitical turbulence, our economy
continues to demonstrate unmatched
resilience and momentum. In FY25,
India’s GDP growth remained nearly
double the global average — propelled
by robust domestic consumption,
infrastructure development,
thriving exports, and a dynamic
digital ecosystem.

the beginning of a new era in India’s
entertainment landscape. Delivered
record viewership and engagement
metrics within the first few months of
commencing operations.
• Oil to Chemicals (O2C):
Demonstrated resilience through
disciplined cost management and
strong domestic placement.
• Oil & Gas: Delivered record EBITDA,
with increased output from KG-D6
and CBM blocks, enhancing India’s
energy independence.
• New Energy: Transitioned from vision
to execution — operationalising
giga-scale solar and battery
energy projects.

Creating the Future — Four New
Engines of Growth
As Reliance approaches its Golden
Jubilee, we have built high-powered
growth engines: Retail, Digital Services,
Media and Entertainment, and
New Energy. Each of these platforms
is technology-first, innovation-led,
and positioned to disrupt industries
while delivering massive value to Indian
consumers and the global market.
Our O2C and Oil and Gas businesses will
continue to grow while catering to India’s
rising energy and materials demand.
We are not just scaling businesses
— we are building platforms that

empower people, reduce inequality,
drive sustainability, and elevate India’s
position in the global economy. Whether
it’s transforming the way Indians shop,
consume data, watch content, or power
their homes and businesses — Reliance
is shaping the future with purpose
and conviction.

Our Foundation — Values, People,
Vision
At the heart of Reliance’s success is
a foundation built on values, trust,
and talent. Our strong balance sheet,
relentless focus on productivity, and
unwavering commitment to excellence
give us the confidence to embrace
bold ambitions.
Our people — across every function and
business — bring passion, ingenuity,
and integrity to their work every day.
Our Board provides the stewardship
and wisdom that guides our long-term
decisions. Our partners and vendors align
closely with our purpose. And above all,
our customers and shareholders place
their trust in us — time and again — and
that is our greatest strength.

Thank You for Believing in Us
To each of you — our valued
shareholders — I express my deepest
gratitude. Your unwavering belief in
Reliance’s vision gives us the courage to
keep pushing boundaries and building
for the future.
The journey ahead is full of promise. With
unwavering faith in India and steadfast
commitment to innovation, sustainability
and inclusion, Reliance is poised to rise
to even greater heights. For India and for
Reliance - the future shines bright!

Reliance Industries Limited

Financial Performance and Review
Operating Environment
Global economic growth remained
healthy at 3.3% in CY24 consistent with
the prior year. Global inflation eased
to 5.7% in CY24 from 6.7% in CY23,
supported by the stabilisation of supply
chains post-COVID and a moderation in
commodity prices. This enabled major
central banks to ease monetary policy,
lowering benchmark rates by 50 to 100
bps in CY24.
However, geopolitical tension and policy
uncertainties, including trade tariffs, led
to volatility in global markets, adversely
impacting energy demand, resulting
in softer prices and narrower margins.
Transportation fuel margins moderated
from elevated levels, and downstream
chemicals margins came under
significant pressure due to incremental
supply additions, particularly from China.
Despite global headwinds, the Indian
economy was remarkably resilient.
While growth moderated to 6.5% in
FY 2024-25 from 9.2% in FY 2023-24,
India retained its position as the fastest
growing major economy in the world.
Domestic consumption witnessed
mixed trends with rural demand
strengthening, and urban consumption
moderating. Macro-prudential regulatory
tightening of credit in FY 2023-24 led
to moderation in personal credit growth
to 16% in FY 2024-25, from 27% in
FY 2023-24. Consumption demand
remained relatively soft during the
first half with general elections and
peak monsoon. The festive season and
Mahakumbh revived domestic markets
in the second half. However, pockets
of urban and rural demand are yet to
fully recover.
External balances in India saw continued
strength in current account with resilient
services surplus (current account deficit
<1% of GDP). Net services exports
clocked another 14% Y-o-Y growth,
driven by continued momentum in digital
services and Global Capability Centres

(GCC). In the second half, capital inflows
slowed as FPIs turned net sellers, leading
to tighter liquidity. In response, the RBI
cut the CRR by 50 bps in December, and
subsequently reduced the policy repo
rate by a cumulative 100 bps to 5.5% by
June 2025. India remains well positioned
for sustained high growth on the back
of favourable demographics and a large
domestic market.

stronger domestic demand and
feedstock flexibility. The segment
witness increased fuel retail sales
through Jio-bp, aided by a favourable
margin environment.
• Consolidated cash profit increased
to J1,46,917 crore, compared to
J1,41,969 crore in FY 2023-24.

Performance Overview

RIL’s gross debt as on 31st Mar’25 stood
at J 3,47,530 crore (US$ 40.7 billion)
Net debt stood at J 1,17,083 crore
(US$ 13.7 billion). Robust internal cashflow generation supported investments
in growth opportunities across business,
while maintaining a conservative
balance sheet and investment grade
credit ratings.

Reliance Industries Limited delivered a
resilient performance for FY 2024-25,
emphasising the strength of its Indiafocused, diverse business portfolio.
Amidst prolonged global volatility,
the Company delivered balanced and
consistent growth across its businesses.
• Consolidated revenue increased by
7.1% to J10,71,174 crore (US$ 125.3

crore (US$ 21.5 billion) from J1,78,290
crore in the previous year, with
consumer businesses contributing
over 50% of consolidated EBITDA
• PAT rose 2.9% year-on-year to
J81,309 crore (US$ 9.5 billion)
Segment Performance:
• Digital Services EBITDA grew 14.7%
supported by widespread adoption
of 5G and broadband across mobility,
home, and enterprise segments. Tariff
revision introduced during the year
was well absorbed, with no adverse
impact on data consumption trends.
• Retail EBITDA grew 8.6%, benefitting
from productivity gains through
network optimisation and improved
operating metrics
• Oil and Gas EBITDA increased by 4.9%
supported by a marginal increase in
production from the KG D6 block
• Oil to Chemicals (O2C) EBITDA
declined by 11.9%, impacted
by weaker fuel cracks and lower
petrochemical margins. The
performance was supported by

Consolidated Net Debt

Capex
Capital expenditure for the financial
year stood at J 1,31,107 crore (US$
15.3 billion), adequately covered
by cash profits. FY 2023-24 capex
was at J 1,31,769 crore. FY 2024-25

Liquidity and
Capital Resources
Macro Environment
FY 2024–25 witnessed high volatility
in financial markets. In India, first
half of the financial year saw global
outperformance of Indian assets
driven by healthy growth momentum,
continued improvement in fiscal
health, which led to prospect of rating
upgrade, and bond index inclusion flows.
Softening global yield environment
helped India benchmark 10y G-sec yield
to ease decisively below 7%, while rupee
remained stable.
However, second half of the financial
year saw large outflows from foreign
portfolio investors, softening of growth
momentum in India and resurgence of
China as an investment destination. This
had a depreciative effect on INR and
tightened banking system liquidity. As a
result, from December 2024 onwards,
RBI began easing financial conditions
through a mix of CRR cut, Repo rate cuts
and injection of rupee liquidity.

Fund Raising
Despite a volatile environment, RIL
successfully executed a multi-currency,
multi-instrument financing strategy,

achieving an optimal capital structure at
competitive costs. The proceeds were
primarily utilised to fund green capital
expenditures and to refinance upcoming
debt maturities.

Industry Overview
Transportation Fuels
In FY 2024-25, the transportation fuel
sector faced demand growth challenges
on the back of geopolitics, energy
transition, efficiency improvement, and
economic concerns. Oil demand rose
by 0.9 mb/d to 103.1 mb/d, while supply
also increased by 1.1 mb/d to 103.3
mb/d. Brent price averaged $ 78.2 per
barrel amidst volatility. In CY24, Refinery
throughput increased by 600 kb/d to
reach 82.9 mb/d, led by new refineries
capacity additions and stronger nonOECD throughputs.
In CY24, gasoline demand increased
by only 89 kb/d and diesel growth
deaccelerated by 158 kb/d. Major
demand came from jet fuel, which surged
by 397 kb/d. Key factors to watch in
2025 would be stagnating demand in
China (EV penetration), aviation growth in
Asia, geopolitical uncertainties and new
economic policies (tariffs & sanctions).
With consistent government push
for roads and air connectivity, Indian
Petroleum Product demand rose to an
all-time high of 239 MMTPA at 2.1% Y-o-Y
growth. Climate consciousness has led
to a sustained rise in charging network
presence, (close to 40,000 charging
stations) with a 6 million EV parc. CNGCBG vehicle parc has also touched
2 million.

affect profitability.
OPPORTUNITIES
• Rising domestic demand & GDP and disposable income create
market expansion opportunities.
• Potential Chinese consumer demand revival could impact
global dynamics positively.
• Placing products strategically based on netback across regions
boosts market penetration.
THREATS
• Tightening heavy crude supply, geopolitical uncertainties,
tariffs and supply chain disruptions threaten operations.
• China’s self-sufficiency, rising exports, and trade agreements
disrupt global trade, impacting margins.
• EV transition, carbon taxes, and sustainability regulations
challenge traditional fuel products.

Outlook
Oil demand is likely to
maintain growth despite EV
penetrations, largely driven by
strong economic growth, China
stimulus measures and possible
easing of geopolitical tension.
Continuing geopolitical and
tariff-related uncertainties may

INTEGRATED APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

Making Significant
Strides towards a
Net Carbon Zero Future
In the current global energy landscape,
the oil and gas sector is rapidly
advancing towards sustainability,
driven by climate challenges and a
growing interest in renewables. India is
emerging as a key force due to its large
energy needs that are critical to its
progress. Reliance seeks to spearhead
this green transformation by deploying
innovative solutions and implementing
decarbonisation strategies, reflecting
its commitment to achieve net-zero
emissions and supporting India’s
broader aspirations for energy security.
Through technological advancements
and large-scale infrastructure
development, Reliance has intensified
its efforts towards reducing carbon
emissions and building a holistic green
energy ecosystem. This transition
from fossil fuels to greener energy
solutions—requiring significant
investments in skills, technology
and large-scale manufacturing—
continues to reinforce the Company’s
commitment to developing its New
Materials and New Energy business.
With a mission to position India as
a global leader in energy transition,
Reliance is investing in domestic
technology and manufacturing
capabilities to help transform India from
a net energy importer to an exporter,
creating long-term value for both the
nation and its shareholders.

The Reliance
Commitment
To achieve its ambitious Net Carbon
Zero target by 2035, Reliance
announced plans to:
• Establish and enable 100 GW of
renewable energy by 2030
• Invest in the value chain,
partnerships and future
technologies, including upstream and
downstream industries
• Build giga factories to create and
offer a fully integrated, end-to-end
renewable energy ecosystem
• Transform its business to Net
Carbon Zero operation

with continuous technological
innovation to build and operate truly
integrated systems that deliver on
cost and performance.
Robust business model
By building a model that captures
the irreversible upward trend in
the demand for green, clean and
renewable energy in India and globally,
alongside the decreasing cost
of production.
Scale
By improving the efficiency,
performance and life cycle of its
assets and operations to achieve total
system optimisation and economics.

Focus on Deep Tech
and R&D Capabilities
Reliance continues to build
deep technology capabilities
through strategic investments
and collaborations with leading
enterprises in solar power, batteries
and electrolysers. These alliances
grant the Company access to new skill
sets and cutting-edge technology,
empowering it to shape the future of
the New Energy sector globally. The
Company is also fostering extensive
in-house research and development to
deliver advanced solutions at costcompetitive levels.

a comprehensive green energy
ecosystem, utilising new technologies
and pursuing innovative approaches,
which contribute to carbon emission
reduction and a more sustainable
future for India.

the ambitious journey to become

Net Carbon Zero by 2035. The
Company envisions becoming one of
the world’s leading New Energy and

engagement involves identifying
and assessing the risks of material
misstatement of the Identified
Sustainability Information whether
due to fraud or error, responding

evaluating the design of
those controls relevant to the

The Management along with the
Board of Directors are responsible for
ensuring that the Company complies
with the provisions of all applicable
laws and maintains the required
statutory records and documents in the
prescribed manner.

Auditor’s
responsibility
Based on audit, my responsibility
is to express an opinion on the
compliance with the applicable laws
and maintenance of records by the
Company. I conducted my audit in
accordance with the auditing standards
CSAS 1 to CSAS 4 (‘CSAS’) prescribed
by the Institute of Company Secretaries
of India. These standards require that
the auditor complies with statutory and
regulatory requirements and plans and
performs the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about compliance with
applicable laws and maintenance
of records.
Due to the inherent limitations of
an audit including internal, financial
and operating controls, there is
an unavoidable risk that some

misstatements or material noncompliances may not be detected, even
though the audit is properly planned
and performed in accordance with
the CSAS.

Jio is the largest operator globally
(outside China) by 5G subscribers, with
191 million Jio True5G subscribers.
JioAirFiber services has accelerated the
pace of home connect and is close to
global leadership in FWA with ~6 million
homes. In addition, there is also strong
momentum in revenue contribution
from content bundling and cloud and
IoT services for enterprises.

Media and
Entertainment
During the year, JioStar - India’s largest
media platform was created by the
merger of Viacom18 and Star India. It
brought together iconic brands across
entertainment and sports, including
Colors, Star Plus, Star Gold and Star
Sports and integrated JioCinema and
Disney+Hotstar into a single super
streaming service, JioHotstar. JioStar
reinforced its pre-eminent position
in the Indian television landscape
with 34% viewership share across
Entertainment genres. JioHotstar
scaled upto 280 million paying
subscribers during IPL Season 18, the
second highest globally and hit peak
MAUs of 503 million in March 2025.
The News business restructuring was
also completed with the merger of
Network18 and TV18, creating India’s
biggest omni-channel news media
powerhouse. The TV News network
was No. 1 in India with leadership
in national and regional markets.

crore on account of higher volumes and
increased domestic product placement.

BOARD’S REPORT

by feedstock sourcing, advantageous
ethane cracking.
Strong domestic demand and
conducive margin environment enabled
higher domestic retail fuel placement
through Jio-bp during the year.

Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas segment achieved highest
ever revenue and EBITDA and
witnessed 3.2% Y-o-Y increase in
Revenue to C 25,211 crore & 4.9 %
increase in EBITDA to C 21,188 crore.
The increase is mainly on account of
higher gas and condensate production
from KG-D6 and CBM Field partly
offset by lower gas price realisation.
KG D6 has three producing fields
namely, R-Cluster, Sat-Cluster and MJ
with combined average gas production
of ~28 MMSCMD and oil & condensate
production of ~21,000 bbls in FY25.
Development is being planned for three
additional wells in R Cluster and one
additional well in Satellite Cluster which
is expected to provide incremental
recovery of ~240 BCF from these fields.
Development Plan for these additional
wells is approved by the Government.
In CBM, first 40 Multi-lateral Wells
(MLW) campaign has been completed.
The campaign has established > 3X
productivity of MLWs compared to
vertical wells. Incremental production
of 0.4 MMSCMD from the 40 MLWs
has helped in successfully reversing
the field decline. Average field
production for FY 25 is ~0.8 MMSCMD.
Based on the success of first MLW
campaign, the Company aims to
continue MLW campaigns and prepare
for development of CBM (East) and
accordingly, has commenced second
40 MLW campaign.
Together these fields are contributing
to 30% of India’s Production.

prudence is reflected in the strong
credit ratings ascribed by rating
agencies. The details of credit ratings

Background
The WomenConnect Challenge India
programme to identify and support
innovative solutions to empower women
in India, for use of digital technology for
positive outcomes for themselves and

life, and decision-making power.
Objective
To assess the underlying factors
influencing baseline trends in women’s
livelihoods and agency and document
the learnings and best practices
Key findings:
Women, Livelihood, and Agency: Higher
restrictions on mobility and participation
in Madhya Pradesh due to social norms
and domestic violence. More women
in Gujarat identify as farmers than in
Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.

Training and Capacity Building: Practices
like multi-layer farming, home-made
fertilizers, livestock training conducted.
Enterprise and Non-Timber Forest
Produce (NTFP): Home-based
enterprises provide secondary incomes.
Collectives: Farmer Interest Group (FIG)
/ Producer Group (PG) participation is
higher in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha
while new groups are emerging in Gujarat,
but leadership in Odisha restricted to
few women.
Market Linkages: With weak market
connections, few women are aggregators.
Increasing women aggregators and
involving men in market awareness could
improve income and access.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of Reliance Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (the “Company”),
which includes its joint operations, which comprise the
Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2025, and the Statement
of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive
Income), the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement
of Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and
notes to the Standalone Financial Statements, including
a summary of material accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid
Standalone Financial Statements give the information required
by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so
required and give a true and fair view in conformity with
the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section
133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state
of affairs of the Company as at 31st March, 2025, and its profit,
total comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in
equity for the year ended on that date.

We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial

independent of the Company in accordance with the Code
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial
Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules
made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and
the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence
obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
Standalone Financial Statements of the current period. These
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion

Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over
financial reporting

We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting
as a key audit matter for the Company because its financial
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally
reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant
transaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and
raw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction
volumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity
of the Company’s systems and data, cyber security has
become more significant. Automated accounting procedures
and IT environment controls, which include IT governance,
IT general controls over program development and changes,
access to program and data and IT operations, IT application
controls and interfaces between IT applications, are required
to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate
financial reporting.

Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters,
management’s judgement regarding recognition,
measurement and disclosure of provisions for these legal
proceedings is inherently uncertain and might change over
time as the outcomes of the legal cases are determined.
Fair Valuation of Investments

As at 31st March, 2025, the Company has investments of
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to
C 78,339 crore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital
the following:
Fibre Private Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair value

internal specialists.
• Discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to
previous period / actual performance with management
to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash
flow forecasts.
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal
specialist and Company’s external experts involved in
the process.
• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the
Standalone Financial Statements.
• Obtained Management Representation Letter as regards to fair
valuation of these investments.

Reliance Industries Limited

• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and
internal audit at the Company and identified IT applications
that are relevant to our audit.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of IT general controls over program development
and changes, access to program and data and IT operations by
engaging IT specialists.
• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity  
at the Company in respect of the overall security architecture
and any key threats addressed by the Company in the
current year.

• Tested the design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of controls relating to data transmission through
the different IT systems to the financial reporting systems by
engaging IT specialists.

Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.

These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair
value hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination
of fair value is based on a high degree of judgement and
input from data that is not directly observable in the market.
Further, the fair value is significantly influenced by the
expected pattern of future benefits of the tangible assets of
JDFPL (fibre assets).

Our procedures included and were not limited to
the following:

• Tested the design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of IT application controls in the key processes
impacting financial reporting of the Company by engaging

Financial Statements and Auditor’s
Report Thereon

Responsibilities of Management
and Board of Directors for the
Standalone Financial Statements

• The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the
other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Annual Report, but does not
include the Consolidated Financial Statements, Standalone
Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to
the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial
performance including other comprehensive loss, cash
flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India,
including Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies;
making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and
presentation of the standalone financial statements that give
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

• Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does
not cover the other information and we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
• In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during
the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated.
• If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report in this regard.

going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements,
management and Board of Directors are responsible for
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate the
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative
but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the
Audit of the Standalone Financial
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of
the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i)
of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion
on whether the Company has adequate internal financial
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a

100

Reliance Industries Limited

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial
Statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the
Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of
a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial
Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative
materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning the scope of
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii)
to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the
Standalone Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate
with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

by law have been kept by the Company so far as it
appears from our examination of those books.
c)

The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and
Loss including Other Comprehensive Income,
the Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of
Changes in Equity dealt with by this Report are in
agreement with the books of account.

d)

In our opinion, the aforesaid Standalone Financial
Statements comply with the Ind AS specified under
Section 133 of the Act.

On the basis of the written representations received
from the directors as on 1st April 2025 and 8th April
2025 taken on record by the Board of Directors,
none of the directors is disqualified as on 31st
March, 2025 from being appointed as a director in
terms of Section 164(2) of the Act.

As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on our
audit, we report that:
a)

We have sought and obtained all the information
and explanations which to the best of our
knowledge and belief were necessary for the
purposes of our audit.

iii.	There has been no delay in transferring
amounts, required to be transferred, to the
Investor Education and Protection Fund by the
Company except for an amount of C 2 crore
which are held in abeyance due to pending
legal cases.

f)	With respect to the adequacy of the internal
financial controls with reference to Standalone
Financial Statements of the Company and the
operating effectiveness of such controls, refer to
our separate Report in “Annexure A”. Our report

and operating effectiveness of the Company’s

belief, no funds have been advanced
or loaned or invested (either from

any other sources or kind of funds)
by the Company to or in any other

A company's internal financial control with reference to
Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements

authorisations of management and directors of the Company;

(Referred to in paragraph 2 under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our Report of even date)

In terms of the information and explanations sought by us and

examined by us in the normal course of audit and to the best

and payment of financial liabilities, other information
accompanying the Standalone Financial Statements
and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and

any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the
audit report that Company is not capable of meeting its
liabilities existing at the date of Balance Sheet as and
when they fall due within a period of one year from the
Balance Sheet date. We, however, state that this is not
an assurance as to the future viability of the Company.
We further state that our reporting is based on the facts
up to the date of the audit report and we neither give
any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling
due within a period of one year from the Balance Sheet
date, will get discharged by the Company as and when
they fall due.

STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes

to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2025

A. Corporate Information
Reliance Industries Limited (“the Company”) is a listed
entity incorporated in India. The registered office of the
Company is located at 3rd Floor, Maker Chambers IV, 222,
Nariman Point, Mumbai - 400 021, India.
The Company is engaged in activities spanning
across hydrocarbon exploration and production, Oil to
Chemicals, Retail and Digital Services.

B. Material Accounting Policies:
B.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis except for following assets and
liabilities which have been measured at fair value amount:
i)

Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities (including
derivative instruments),

ii)

Defined Benefit Plans – Plan Assets, and

iii)

Equity settled Share Based Payments

The Financial Statements of the Company have been
prepared to comply with the Indian Accounting
standards (‘Ind AS’), including the Rules notified under
the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013,
(as amended from time to time) and Presentation and
disclosure requirements of Division II of Schedule III to
the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS Compliant Schedule
III) as amended from time to time. The Company follows
indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7 – Statement of
Cash Flows for presentation of its cash flows.
The Company’s Financial Statements are presented in
Indian Rupees (C), which is also its functional currency
and all values are rounded to the nearest crore
(C00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated.

B.2 Summary of Material Accounting Policies
(a) Current and Non-Current Classification
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the
Balance Sheet based on Current/ Non-Current
classification considering an operating cycle
of 12 months being the time elapsed between
deployment of resources and the realisation/
settlement in cash and cash equivalents thereagainst.

(b) Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost,
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates
less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses, if any. Such cost includes purchase price,
borrowing cost and any cost directly attributable
to bringing the assets to its working condition for
its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange

118

Reliance Industries Limited

contracts and adjustments arising from exchange
rate variations attributable to the assets. In case of
land the Company has availed fair value as deemed
cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.

interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be
readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, the Company uses incremental
borrowing rate.

Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to
project, net of income earned during the project
development stage prior to its intended use,
are considered as pre-operative expenses and
disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.

For short-term and low value leases, the Company
recognises the lease payments as an operating
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment
is provided using written down value method on
depreciable amount except in case of certain
assets of Oil to Chemicals and Other segment
which are depreciated using straight-line method.
Depreciation is provided based on useful life of
the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the
Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the
following assets, where useful life is as under:
Particular

Depreciation

Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful
life: 2 years or more)

Over its useful life as
technically assessed

Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful
life: up to 2 years)

100% depreciated in the
year of addition

Plant and Machinery
(useful life: 25 to 50 years)

Over its useful life as
technically assessed

Buildings (Useful life: 30 to
65 years)

Over its useful life as
technically assessed

The residual values, useful lives and methods of
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment are
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted
prospectively, if appropriate.

(c) Leases
The Company, as a lessee, recognises a rightof-use asset and a lease liability for its leasing
arrangements, if the contract conveys the right
to control the use of an identified asset. Initially
the right-of-use assets measured at cost which
comprises initial cost of the lease liability adjusted
for any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date plus any initial direct costs
incurred. Subsequently measured at cost less
any accumulated depreciation/ amortisation,
accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted
for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The right-of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised
using the straight-line method from the
commencement date over the shorter of lease term
or useful life of right-of-use asset.
The Company measures the lease liability at the
present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at the commencement date of the lease.
The lease payments are discounted using the

obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products
which are valued at net realisable value.
Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing
materials, trading and other products are
determined on weighted average basis.

(f) Provisions

(d) Intangible Assets

Provisions are recognised when the Company has
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. If the effect of the time value of money
is material, provisions are discounted using a current
pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the
risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

		Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and
rebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion
and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes
purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost
directly attributable to bringing the asset to its
working condition for the intended use, net charges
on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments
arising from exchange rate variations attributable to
the Intangible Assets.
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to
project, net of income earned during the project
development stage prior to its intended use, are
considered as pre-operative expenses and disclosed
under Intangible Assets Under Development.
The Company assesses if useful life of an
intangible asset is finite or indefinite. A summary
of amortisation/depletion policies applied to the
Company’s Intangible Assets to the extent of
depreciable amount is as follows:
Particular

Amortisation / Depletion

Technical
Know-How

Over the useful life of the underlying
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years.

Computer
Software

Over a period of 5 years.

Development W.r.t. Oil and Gas, depleted using the
Rights
unit of production method. The cost of
producing wells along with its related
facilities including decommissioning
costs are depleted in proportion of oil
and gas production achieved vis-à-vis
Proved Developed Reserves. The cost
for common facilities including its
decommissioning costs are depleted
using Proved Reserves. With respect
to other development rights, these are
amortised over the period of contract.
Others

In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount
amortised to date is not less than
the aggregate rebate availed by the
Company.

		The amortisation period and the amortisation
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful life
are reviewed at each reporting date.

(e) Inventories
Items of inventories are measured at lower of
cost and net realisable value after providing for

		

Provision for Decommissioning Liability
The Company records a provision for
decommissioning costs towards site restoration
activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at
the present value of future expenditure using a
current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil
decommissioning obligations and are recognised
as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any
change in the present value of the expenditure,
other than unwinding of discount on the provision,
is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the
corresponding asset. The change in the provision
due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in
the Statement of Profit and Loss.

(g) Contingent Liabilities
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when
there is a possible obligation arising from past
events, the existence of which will be confirmed
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one
or more uncertain future events not wholly within
the control of the Company or a present obligation
that arises from past events where it is either not
probable that an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits will be required to settle or a
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.

(h) Current Tax and Deferred Tax
		The tax expenses for the period comprise of current
tax and deferred tax. The Company exercises
judgment in computation of current tax considering
the relevant rulings and reassesses the carrying
amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each
reporting period.

STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes
(i)

to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2025

Share Based Payments
In case of Group equity-settled share-based
payment transactions, where the Company grants
stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries,
the transactions are accounted by increasing
the cost of investment in subsidiary with a
corresponding credit in the equity.

(j)	Foreign Currencies Transactions and
Translation
Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency
borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which
are related to the acquisition or construction of
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of
such assets.

(k) Revenue Recognition
Revenue from contracts with customers is
recognised when control of the goods or services
are transferred to the customer at an amount that
reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. The Company is generally
the principal as it typically controls the goods or
services before transferring them to the customer.

Revenue is measured at the amount of
consideration which the Company expects to be
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct
goods or services to a customer as specified in the
contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of
third parties (for example taxes and duties collected
on behalf of the government). Consideration is
generally due upon satisfaction of performance
obligations and a receivable is recognised when it
becomes unconditional.
Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60
days from the shipment or delivery of goods or
completion of services as the case may be. The
Company provides volume rebates to certain
customers once the quantity of products purchased
during the period exceeds a threshold specified and
also accrues discounts to certain customers based
on customary business practices which is derived
on the basis of crude price volatility and various
market demand – supply situations. Consideration
are determined based on its most likely amount.
Generally, sales of petroleum products contain
provisional pricing features where revenue is initially
recognised based on provisional price. Difference
between final settlement price and provisional price
is recognised subsequently.

120

Reliance Industries Limited

(l)

The Company uses historical default rates to
determine impairment loss on the portfolio
of trade receivables. At every reporting date
these historical default rates are reviewed
and changes in the forward-looking estimates
are analysed.

Financial Instruments

		i.

Financial Assets
Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are
recognised using trade date accounting. Trade
receivables that do not contain a significant
financing component are measured at
transaction price.
The Company has elected to account for its
investments in subsidiaries, associates and
joint venture at cost less impairment loss
(if any).
All other equity investments are measured at
fair value, with value changes recognised in
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those
equity investments for which the Company
has elected to present the value changes in
‘Other Comprehensive Income’. However,
dividend on such equity investments are
recognised in Statement of Profit and loss
when the Company’s right to receive payment
is established. The investments in preference
shares with the right to surplus assets which
are in nature of equity in accordance with
Ind AS 32 are treated as separate category
of investment and measured at Fair Value
Through Other Comprehensive Income
(FVTOCI). Other Financial Assets are generally
measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss
(FVTPL) except where the Company, based
on the business model objectives, measures
these at Amortised Cost or Fair Value Through
Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
The Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL)
model, for evaluating impairment of Financial
Assets other than those measured at FVTPL.
Expected Credit Losses are measured through
a loss allowance at an amount equal to:

• The 12-months expected credit losses
(expected credit losses that result from
those default events on the financial
instrument that are possible within 12
months after the reporting date); or
• Full lifetime expected credit losses
(expected credit losses that result from all
possible default events over the life of the
financial instrument).
For Trade Receivables, the Company applies
‘simplified approach’ which requires expected
lifetime losses to be recognised from initial
recognition of the receivables.

For other assets, the Company uses 12 month
ECL to provide for impairment loss where
there is no significant increase in credit risk. If
there is significant increase in credit risk full
lifetime ECL is used.

		ii.

Financial Liabilities
For trade and other payables maturing
within one year from the balance sheet
date, the carrying amounts are determined
to approximate fair value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.

		

iii.	Derivative Financial Instruments and
Hedge Accounting
The Company uses various derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps,
currency swaps, forwards & options and
commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of
changes in interest rates, exchange rates and
commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge
relationship, the Company formally designates
and documents the hedge relationship to
which the Company wishes to apply hedge
accounting and the risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge.

			Any gains or losses arising from changes in the
fair value of derivatives are taken directly to
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income
and later to Statement of Profit and Loss
when the hedged item affects profit or loss
or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged
forecast transaction subsequently results in
the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or
Non-Financial liability.
Hedges that meet the criteria  for hedge
accounting are accounted for as follows:
			A.

Cash Flow Hedge
The Company designates derivative
contracts or non-derivative Financial
Assets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments
to mitigate the risk of movement in
interest rates and foreign exchange rates
for foreign exchange exposure on highly
probable future cash flows attributable to
a recognised asset or liability or forecast
cash transactions.

			B.

Fair Value Hedge
The Company designates derivative
contracts or non-derivative Financial
Assets/Liabilities as hedging instruments
to mitigate the risk of change in fair value
of hedged item due to movement in
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
commodity prices.

		iv.	
Offsetting
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are
offset and the net amount is presented in
the balance sheet when, and only when, the
Company has a legally enforceable right to set
off the amount and it intends, either to settle
them on a net basis or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.

(m) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of
joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities
as well as income and expenditure are accounted on
the basis of available information on a line-by-line
basis with similar items in the Company’s Financial
Statements, according to the participating interest
of the Company.
The Company follows the Guidance Note on
Accounting for Oil and Gas producing activities
– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India for the purposes of the
accounting.  Seismic costs, geological and
geophysical studies, petroleum exploration
license fees and general and administration costs
directly attributable to exploration and evaluation
activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on
acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on
exploration and evaluation other than those which
are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible
Assets Under Development. All development
costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are
also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under
Development. Once a well is ready to commence
commercial production, the costs accumulated in
Intangible Assets Under Development are classified
as Intangible Assets corresponding to proved
developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration
and evaluation expenditure which does not result
in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all
cost pertaining to production are charged to the
Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company uses technical estimation of reserves
as per the Petroleum Resources Management
System guidelines 2011 and standard geological
and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve
review and evaluation is carried out annually.

C.	Critical Accounting Judgements
and Key Sources of Estimation
Uncertainty
The preparation of the Company’s Financial Statements
requires management to make judgement, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue,
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying
disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and
estimates could result in outcomes that require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities
affected in next financial years.

(A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves
The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and
natural gas reserves requires significant judgements
and estimates to be applied and these are regularly
reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of
geological and engineering data, reservoir performance
data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of
new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the
determination of the Company’s estimates of its oil and
natural gas reserves. The Company bases its proved
reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable
certainty with rigorous technical and commercial
assessments based on conventional industry practice
and regulatory requirements.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to
calculate depletion charges for the Company’s oil and
gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated
proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising
the remaining carrying value of the asset over the
expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves
also have a direct impact on the assessment of the
recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the
Financial Statements.
Details on proved reserves and production both on
product and geographical basis are provided in Note 33.2.

(B)	Property Plant and Equipment/ Intangible
Assets
Estimates are involved in determining the cost
attributable to bringing the assets to the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the manner intended by the management. Property,
Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/
amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking

122

Reliance Industries Limited

into account estimated residual value. Management
reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of
the assets annually in order to determine the amount

(D)	Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial
Assets

Right-of-Use Assets:

The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based
on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash
loss rates. The Company uses judgement in making these
assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment
calculation, based on Company’s past history, existing
market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates
at the end of each reporting period.
	In case of non-financial assets, assessment of
impairment indicators involves consideration of future
risks. Further, the Company estimates asset’s recoverable
amount, which is higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating
Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its
value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal,
recent market transactions are taken into account, if
no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate
valuation model is used.

VIII) Sensitivity Analysis

		

b)

Significant Actuarial Assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected
salary increase and employee turnover. The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably
possible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions
constant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:

The fair value at grant date is determined using “Black Scholes Model” which takes into account the exercise price, term
of the option, share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying shares, expected dividend yield and
the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.
The model inputs for options granted during the year ended 31st March, 2021 , 31st March, 2022 and 31st March, 2024

These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and
Salary Risk.
Investment Risk
Interest Risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.

Longevity Risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate
of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life
expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

Salary Risk

The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

33.4 (a)	
Government of India (“GoI”) sent a demand notice to the KG D6 block contractor (RIL, BP Exploration (Alpha) Limited
and Niko (NECO) Limited) (together “Contractor”) on 3rd November 2016, on account of production of gas allegedly
migrated from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as operator and on behalf of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against
the GoI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July 2018 (“Arbitration Award”), upheld Contractor’s claims.
Vide Judgment dated 9th May 2023, a single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration Award and
dismissed GoI’s appeal challenging the award. On an appeal by GOI, vide judgment dated 14th February 2025, the
Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court allowed GoI’s appeal and set aside the judgment of the single judge and
the Arbitration Award.
A demand letter dated 1st March 2025 for payment of $ 2.81 billion (RIL share $ 1.87 billion) was sent by GoI to the
Contractor. RIL, on 17th March 2025, responded that it is not liable to make any payment to GoI and that the demand
letter is without any factual or legal basis and is liable to be withdrawn. RIL will be filing an appeal against the judgement
of the Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court.
		(b)	
Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants)
against GOI under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain
PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this
matter, some of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be
issued. The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in
court judgements that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour.
		(c)	
NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a
period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company's fact witnesses in
the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC. On 2nd December 2024, an SLP was filed by RIL before the Supreme Court
against an Order of the Bombay High Court in the NTPC suit, directing redaction of certain portions of RIL’s Affidavit. The
matter is presently sub-judice.
		
Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible
exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ litigations.
Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.
33.5 Exploration for and Evaluation of Oil and Gas Resources
The following financial information represents the amounts included in Intangible Assets under Development relating to
activity associated with the exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas resources.
(C in crore)

*1 cubic meter (M3) = 35.315 cubic feet, 1 cubic feet = 1000 BTU and 1 MT = 7.5 bbl

Particulars

The reserve estimates for producing fields are revised based on the performance of producing fields and with respect to
discovered fields, the revision are based on the revised geological and reservoir simulation studies.

Exploration & Evaluation (E&E) Cost

33.3	The Government of India (“GoI”), disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”), relating to Block
KG-DWN-98/3 (“KG D6”) entitles the Company to recover. The Company maintains that the Contractor is entitled to recover
all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any
Contract Cost. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The matter is presently at the
stage of Final Hearing as part of arbitration proceedings. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million (for C 1,407 crore) being
the Company's share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,111 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as
contingent liability as on 31st March 2025.

168

		In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January 2014, the GOI notified
the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to instruct
customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the
guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to
the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295
crore (net) as at 31th March 2025. Revenue has been recognised at the GoI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas
quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under
cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.

The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities.
Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, advance payments
and factoring & forfaiting without recourse to the Company to avoid concentration of risk. The company restricts its fixed
income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global and local financial
markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from
across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s cash flow position and
ensures that the Company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.

6-12 Months

The Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In
accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses overthe-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing
financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables
from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness.
Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit information is regularly
shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of
credit deterioration.

Hedge Accounting
The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other
feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a structured
risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which
allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter
swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge
ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method
and critical term matching method.
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
- Differences in the timing of the cash flows.
- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves).
- The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.

Disallowance of certain costs under the
production sharing contract, relating to Block

Basis for Opinion

(d)

• Assessed the management’s position through discussions with
the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions obtained by
the Parent (where considered necessary) on both, the probability
of success in the aforesaid cases, and the magnitude of any
potential loss.

• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent’s legal
counsel involved in the process.

• Obtained Management Representation Letter on the assessment
of these matters.

Securities Appellate Tribunal judgement dated 5th
November, 2020, dismissing the Parent’s appeal
made in relation to Order passed by the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) under Section 11B of
the SEBI Act, 1992 in connection with trades by the
Parent in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares
of Reliance Petroleum Limited, then subsidiary of the
Parent, against which an appeal has been filed with
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India which is pending.
Refer Note 34 (III) to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters,
management’s judgement regarding recognition,
measurement and disclosure of provisions for these
legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and might
change over time as the outcomes of the legal cases
are determined.
	Accordingly, it has been considered as a key
audit matter.
2.

• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness
of the controls established by the Parent in the process of
evaluation of litigation matters.

• Rolled out enquiry letters to the Parent’s legal counsel and
assessed the responses received.

2.	Matter relating to trading in shares of Reliance
Petroleum Limited (‘RPL’):

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit
of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be
communicated in our report.

Our audit procedures included and were not limited to
the following:

(c) 	Arbitration matters relating to difference in

Contracts (PSC) provisions in Panna-Mukta and
Tapti blocks.

We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing
(SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our
responsibilities under those Standards are further
described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint
ventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”)
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We
believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit
evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their
reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of the
Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated

Fair Valuation of Investments

As at 31st March 2025, the Parent has investments of C
78,339 crore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital
Fibre Private Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair
value as per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.
These investments are Level 3 investments as per
the fair value hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly
determination of fair value is based on a high degree
of judgement and input from data that is not directly
observable in the market. Further, the fair value is
significantly influenced by the expected pattern of future
benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fibre assets).
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.
Refer Notes 2 and 36A to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Our audit procedures included and were not limited to
the following:
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness
of the controls established by the Parent in the process of
determination of fair value of the investments.
• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the management by
involvement of internal valuation specialists.
• Assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts,
discount rates, expected growth rates and its effect on business
and terminal growth rates used and the valuation methodology
inter-alia through involvement of the internal specialists.
• Discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to
previous year / actual performance with management to evaluate
the inputs and assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts.
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal
specialist and Parent’s external experts involved in the process.
• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
• Obtained Management Representation Letter as regards to fair
valuation of these investments.

Key Audit Matter

Auditor’s Response

Revenue Recognition

(a)	The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’),
a step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported
revenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the
high volumes of data processed by the IT systems and
the complexity of those IT systems.

• Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment
inter-alia for access controls, change management and
application specific controls in the IT Systems over RJIL’s billing
and other relevant support systems.
• Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue per the
billing system and the financial records. Performed procedures to
test the computation of revenue and deferred revenue.

(b)

The auditors of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited
(‘RRVL’), a subsidiary of the Parent, have reported
revenue recognition as a key audit matter at its
subsidiary viz., Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’). RRL
is engaged in organised retail and the trading
transactions generating revenue comprising of
high volume of individually small transactions which
increases the risk of revenue being recognised
inappropriately and which highlights the criticality
of sound internal processes of summarising and
recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption
baskets on a principal basis and recognises full
value of consideration as its revenue. The revenue
is recognised on transfer of control of traded goods
to the customers. Transfer of control coincides with
collection of cash or cash equivalent from customers.
In view of the above and since revenue is a key
performance indicator for RRL, revenue recognition is
identified as a key audit matter.

In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the
auditors of RRVL, we performed inquiry of and oversight on
the audit procedure performed by them to address the key
audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary auditor, the audit
procedures performed by them included and were not limited
to the following:
• Obtained understanding of the process followed by the
management to record the revenue from each store.
• Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of
the internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of
revenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.
• Involved information technology specialist to test the automated
controls and reports involved in the reconciliation of revenue.
• On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various
dates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue recorded
through various modes of payment from RRL’s accounting
system. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such details with
the underlying collection made by RRL as per cash receipts,
merchant payment reports, and other third party supporting.

Business Combination

During the year, the Parent acquired control over Star
India Private Limited (SIPL) by way of Composite Scheme
of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) involving demerger of
Group’s media and Jio Cinema undertaking into SIPL and
the Group consequently acquired control of SIPL.
The auditors of SIPL, a subsidiary of the Parent, have
reported to us, the audit of accounting of this reverse
acquisition to be a key audit matter since this is a
significant transaction during the year that required
significant management judgement regarding:
• Determination of the acquisition date.
• Determination of the fair value of
consideration transferred.
• Identification and measurement of the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
• Identification of intangible assets acquired through
business combination.

• In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information, compare with the financial statements /
financial information of the subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates audited by the other auditors, to the extent it
relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the
work of the other auditors and consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the
course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. Other information so far as it relates to the
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, is traced from
their financial statements / financial information audited by

• If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we

Responsibilities of Management
and Board of Directors for the
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters
stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the
preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position, consolidated financial performance including other
comprehensive loss, consolidated cash flows and consolidated
changes in equity of the Group including its associates and
joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles
generally accepted in India including Ind AS specified under
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of
the companies included in the Group and of its associates and
joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the
Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates
and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate
accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to

186

Reliance Industries Limited

the preparation and presentation of the financial statements
that give a true and fair view and are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have
been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements by the Board of Directors of the Parent,
as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
respective Management and Board of Directors of the
companies included in the Group and of its associates and
joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the
respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing,
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board
of Directors either intend to liquidate their respective entities or
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of
the Group and of its associates and joint ventures.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the
Audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the
Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by the management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may
cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its
associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint
ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial
Statements represent the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the
financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group and its associates and joint ventures to
express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the audit of the financial statements of such
entities or business activities included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements of which we are the independent
auditors. For the other entities or business activities included
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been
audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible
for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the
Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a
reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial
Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative
materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning the scope of
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii)
to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the
Parent and such other entities included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical

requirements regarding independence, and to communicate
with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

companies, its associate companies and joint venture
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
based on the internal control with reference to Consolidated
Financial Statements criteria established by the respective
Companies considering the essential components of internal
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These
responsibilities include the design, implementation and
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient
conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under
the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its
associate companies and its joint venture companies, which
are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the
Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10)
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require

that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference
to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud
or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the
subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint venture
companies, which are companies incorporated in India,
in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the
Parent, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies
and its joint venture companies, which are companies
incorporated in India.

Meaning of Internal Financial
Controls with reference to
Consolidated Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to
Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorisations of management and directors of the Company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or

effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal
Financial Controls with reference to
Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of
any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference
to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

202

The financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis
by adding together like items of assets, liabilities,

Reliance Industries Limited

(b)

Profits or losses resulting from intra-group
transactions that are recognised in assets, such as
Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, are
eliminated in full.

(c)

In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are
consolidated at the average rate prevailing during
the year. All assets and liabilities are converted
at rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any
exchange difference arising on consolidation is
recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation

transactions from 1st January, 2025 to 31st March,
2025 in respect of subsidiaries / joint ventures
/ associates having financial year ended 31st
December 2024.

B.3 Summary of Material Accounting Policies
(a) Current and Non-Current Classification
The Group present assets and liabilities in the
Balance Sheet based on Current / Non-Current
classification considering an operating cycle
of 12 months being the time elapsed between
deployment of resources and the realisation /
settlement in cash and cash equivalents thereagainst.

(b) Business Combination
For each business combination, the Group elects
whether to measure the non-controlling interests
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

(c) Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost,
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebate
less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss,
if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing
cost and any cost directly attributable to bringing
the assets to its working condition for its intended
use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and
adjustments arising from exchange rate variations
attributable to the assets. In case of land the Group
has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of
transition to Ind AS.

Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to
project, net of income earned during the project
development stage prior to its intended use,
are considered as pre-operative expenses and
disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment
is provided using written down value method on
depreciable amount except in case of certain assets
of Oil to Chemicals and Other Segment, which are
depreciated using straight-line method. Depreciation
is provided based on useful life of the assets as
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act,
2013 except in respect of the following assets,
where useful life is as under:
Particular

Depreciation

Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful
life: 2 years or more)

Over its useful life as
technically assessed

Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful
life: up to 2 years)

100% depreciated in the
year of addition

Premium on Leasehold Land Over the period of lease
(range up to 99 years)
term
Plant and Machinery (useful Over its useful life as
life: 25 to 50 years)
technically assessed
Buildings (useful life: 30 to
65 years)

Over its useful life as
technically assessed

The residual values, useful lives and methods of
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment are
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted
prospectively, if appropriate.

(d) Leases
The Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-ofuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing
arrangements, if the contract conveys the right
to control the use of an identified asset. Initially
the right-of-use assets measured at cost which
comprises initial cost of the lease liability adjusted
for any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date plus any initial direct costs
incurred. Subsequently measured at cost less
any accumulated depreciation / amortisation,
accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted
for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The right-of-use assets is depreciated / amortised
using the straight-line method from the
commencement date over the shorter of lease term
or useful life of right-of-use asset.
The Group measures the lease liability at the
present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at the commencement date of the lease.
The lease payments are discounted using the
interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can
be readily determined. If that rate cannot be

readily determined, the Group uses incremental
borrowing rate.
For short-term and low value leases, the Group
recognises the lease payments as an operating
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

(e) Intangible Assets
		Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebate
less accumulated amortisation / depletion and
impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes purchase
price, borrowing costs, and any cost directly
attributable to bringing the asset to its working
condition for the intended use, net charges on
foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising
from exchange rate variations attributable to the
Intangible Assets.
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating
to project, net of income earned during
the project development stage prior to its
intended use, are considered as pre-operative
expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets
Under Development.
The Group assesses if useful life of an intangible
asset is finite or indefinite. A summary of the
amortisation / depletion policies applied to the
Group’s Intangible Assets with a finite life to the
extent of depreciable amount is as follows.
Particulars

Amortisation

Technical
Know-How

Over the useful life of the underlying
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years

Computer
Software

Over a period of 5 to 10 years.

Development With respect to Oil and Gas,
Rights
depleted using the unit of production
method. The cost of producing
wells along with its related facilities
including decommissioning costs
are depleted in proportion of oil and
gas production achieved vis-à-vis
Proved Developed Reserves. The cost
for common facilities including its
decommissioning costs are depleted
using Proved Reserves. With respect
to other development rights, these are
amortised over the period of contract.
License Fee

Amortised over the remainder of
the license period from the date of
commencement of the commercial
operation.

Spectrum
Fees

Amortised from the date of
commencement of commercial
operation over the balance validity

Notes

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2025

Particulars

Amortisation

Others

In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount
amortised to date is not less than
the aggregate rebate availed by the
Group. In case of Platforms and related
Product Developments, over a period
ranging from 5 to 25 years.

		The amortisation period and the amortisation
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful life
are reviewed at each reporting date.

(f) Inventories
Items of inventories are measured at lower of
cost and net realisable value after providing for
obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products
which are valued at net realisable value.
Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing
materials, trading and other products are
determined on weighted average basis.

(g) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. If the effect of the time value of money
is material, provisions are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate,
the risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

		

Provision for Decommissioning Liability
The Group records a provision for decommissioning
costs towards site restoration activity.
Decommissioning costs are provided at the
present value of future expenditure using a current
pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil
decommissioning obligations and are recognised
as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any
change in the present value of the expenditure,
other than unwinding of discount on the provision,
is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the
corresponding asset. The change in the provision
due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

(h) Contingent Liabilities
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when
there is a possible obligation arising from past
events, the existence of which will be confirmed
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one
or more uncertain future events not wholly within
the control of the Group or a present obligation
that arises from past events where it is either not

204

Reliance Industries Limited

probable that an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits will be required to settle or a
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.

(i)

Current Tax and Deferred Tax

		The tax expenses for the period comprise of current
tax and deferred tax. The Group exercises judgment
in computation of current tax considering the
relevant rulings and reassesses the carrying amount
of deferred tax assets / liabilities at the end of each
reporting period.

(j)

Share Based Payments
In case of Group equity-settled share-based
payment transactions, where the Company grants
stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries,
the transactions are accounted by increasing
the cost of investment in subsidiary with a
corresponding credit in the equity.

(k)	Foreign Currencies Transactions and
Translation
Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency
borrowings taken prior to 1st April, 2016 which
are related to the acquisition or construction of
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost
of such assets.

(l)

Revenue Recognition
Revenue from contracts with customers is
recognised when control of the goods or services
are transferred to the customer at an amount that
reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. The Group is generally
considered as principal, as it typically controls
the goods or services before transferring them to
the customer.
Revenue is measured at the amount of
consideration which the Group expects to be
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct
goods or services to a customer as specified in the
contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of
third parties (for example taxes and duties collected
on behalf of the government). Consideration is
generally due upon satisfaction of performance
obligations and a receivable is recognised when it
becomes unconditional. Generally, the credit period
varies between 0-60 days from the shipment
or delivery of goods or completion of services
as the case may be. The Group provides volume
rebates to certain customers once the quantity of
products purchased during the period exceeds a
threshold specified and also accrues discounts to
certain customers based on customary business
practices which is derived on the basis of crude
price volatility and various market demand – supply
situations. Consideration are determined based on

its most likely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum
products contain provisional pricing features where
revenue is initially recognised based on provisional
price. Difference between final settlement price
and provisional price is recognised subsequently.

The Group uses historical default rates to
determine impairment loss on the portfolio
of trade receivables. At every reporting date
these historical default rates are reviewed
and changes in the forward-looking estimates
are analysed.

(m) Financial Instruments
		i.

Financial Assets
Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are
recognised using trade date accounting. Trade
receivables that do not contain a significant
financing component are measured at
transaction price.

For other assets, the Group uses 12 month
ECL to provide for impairment loss where
there is no significant increase in credit risk.
If there is significant increase in credit risk full
lifetime ECL is used.

		ii.

The investments in associates and joint
venture are accounted on equity method.
All other equity investments are measured
at fair value, with value changes recognised
in Statement of Profit and Loss, except for
those equity investments for which the Group
has elected to present the value changes in
‘Other Comprehensive Income’. However,
dividend on such equity investments are
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss
when the Company’s right to receive payment
is established. The investments in preference
shares with the right to surplus assets which
are in nature of equity in accordance with
Ind AS 32 are treated as separate category
of investment and measured at Fair Value
Through Other Comprehensive Income
(FVTOCI). Other Financial Assets are generally
measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss
(FVTPL) except where the Group, based on
the business model objectives, measures
these at Amortised Cost or Fair Value Through
Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
The Group uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL)
model, for evaluating impairment of Financial
Assets other than those measured at Fair
Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).
Expected Credit Losses are measured through
a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
• The 12-months expected credit losses
(expected credit losses that result from
those default events on the financial
instrument that are possible within 12
months after the reporting date); or
• Full lifetime expected credit losses
(expected credit losses that result from all
possible default events over the life of the
financial instrument).
For Trade Receivables, the Group applies
‘simplified approach’ which requires expected
lifetime losses to be recognised from initial
recognition of the receivables.

		

Financial Liabilities
For trade and other payables maturing
within one year from the balance sheet
date, the carrying amounts are determined
to approximate fair value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.

iii.	Derivative Financial Instruments and
Hedge Accounting
The Group uses various derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps,
currency swaps, forwards & options and
commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of
changes in interest rates, exchange rates and
commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge
relationship, the Group formally designates
and documents the hedge relationship to
which the Group wishes to apply hedge
accounting and the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking
the hedge.

			Any gains or losses arising from changes in the
fair value of derivatives are taken directly to
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income
and later to Statement of Profit and Loss
when the hedged item affects profit or loss
or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged
forecast transaction subsequently results in
the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or
Non-Financial liabilities.
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge
accounting are accounted for as follows:
			A.

Cash Flow Hedge
The Group designates derivative
contracts or non-derivative Financial
Assets / Liabilities as hedging
instruments to mitigate the risk of
movement in interest rates and foreign
exchange rates for foreign exchange
exposure on highly probable future cash
flows attributable to a recognised asset
or liability or forecast cash transactions.

Notes

		iv.

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2025
Fair Value Hedge
The Group designates derivative
contracts or non-derivative Financial
Assets / Liabilities as hedging
instruments to mitigate the risk of
change in fair value of hedged item due
to movement in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates and commodity prices.

Offsetting
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are
offset and the net amount is presented in
the balance sheet when, and only when, the
Group has a legally enforceable right to set
off the amount and it intends, either to settle
them on a net basis or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.

(n) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of
joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities
as well as income and expenditure are accounted
on the basis of available information on a lineby-line basis with similar items in the Financial
Statements, according to the participating interest
of the Group.
The Group follows the Guidance Note on
Accounting for Oil and Gas producing activities
– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India for the purpose of accounting.
Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies,
petroleum exploration license fees and general
and administration costs directly attributable to
exploration and evaluation activities are expensed
off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest
in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and
evaluation other than those which are expensed
off are accounted for as Intangible Assets Under
Development. All development costs incurred in
respect of proved reserves are also capitalised
under Intangible Assets Under Development.
Once a well is ready to commence commercial
production, the costs accumulated in Intangible
Assets Under Development are classified as
Intangible Assets corresponding to proved
developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration
and evaluation expenditure which does not result
in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all
cost pertaining to production are charged to the
Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Group uses technical estimation of reserves as
per the Petroleum Resources Management System
guidelines 2011 and standard geological and
reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review
and evaluation is carried out annually.

206

Reliance Industries Limited

C.	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
JUDGEMENTS AND KEY
SOURCES OF ESTIMATION
UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements
require management to make judgement, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue,
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying
disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions
and estimates could result in outcomes that require a
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or
liabilities affected in future periods.

(A)	ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS
RESERVES
The determination of the Group’s estimated
oil and natural gas reserves require significant
judgements and estimates to be applied and these
are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such
as the availability of geological and engineering
data, reservoir performance data, acquisition
and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and
commodity prices all impact on the determination
of the Group’s estimates of its oil and natural gas
reserves. The Group bases its proved reserves
estimates on the requirement of reasonable
certainty with rigorous technical and commercial
assessments based on conventional industry
practice and regulatory requirements.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to
calculate depletion charges for the Group’s oil and
gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated
proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by
amortising the remaining carrying value of the
asset over the expected future production. Oil
and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact
on the assessment of the recoverability of asset
carrying values reported in the financial statements.
Details on proved reserves and production both
on product and geographical basis are provided in
Note 33.

(B)	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT /
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Estimates are involved in determining the cost
attributable to bringing the assets to the location
and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by the
management. Property, Plant and Equipment /
Other Intangible Assets are depreciated / amortised
over their estimated useful life, after taking into
account estimated residual value. Spectrum Cost
is amortised over its balance validity period, based

on the expected pattern of consumption of the
expected future economic benefits.
Management reviews the estimated useful life
and residual values of the assets annually in
order to determine the amount of depreciation /
amortisation to be recorded during any reporting
period. The useful life and residual values are
based on the Group’s historical experience with
similar assets and take into account anticipated
technological and future risks. The depreciation /
amortisation for future periods is revised if there are
significant changes from previous estimates.

(C) PROVISIONS
		The timing of recognition and quantification of
the liability (including litigations) requires the
application of judgement to existing facts and
circumstances, which can be subject to change.
The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities
are reviewed regularly and revised to take account
of changing facts and circumstances.

(D)	IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL,
INTANGIBLE ASSETS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT AND INTANGIBLE
ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE
Management reviews the carrying value of
goodwill, intangible assets under development
and intangible assets with indefinite useful
life annually, to determine whether there has
been any impairment by allocating the value of
goodwill, intangible assets under development and
intangible assets with indefinite useful life to a Cash
Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has identified
CGUs’ for this purpose, considering the nature of
the businesses to which each of the CGU relates.
Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU is
aggregate of cash flow projections, for five years as
approved by Senior Management and beyond five
years extrapolated using a long-term growth rate
which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash flow projections
are discounted by a pre-tax discount rate, being the
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which
ranges from 8% to 12%.
The Management believes that any reasonably
possible change in the above key assumptions
on which recoverable amount is based would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the
aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
have been allocated to the respective CGUs. During
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Group has
determined that there is no impairment towards
these assets.

(E)	IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL AND
NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
The impairment provisions for Financial Assets
are based on assumptions about risk of default
and expected cash loss rates. The Group uses
judgement in making these assumptions and
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation,
based on Group’s past history, existing market
conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at
the end of each reporting period.
In case of non-financial assets, the Group estimates
asset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an
asset’s or Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value
less costs of disposal and its value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value
less costs of disposal, recent market transactions
are taken into account, if no such transactions
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model
is used.

(F) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
For estimates relating to fair value of financial
instruments refer Note 36 of Consolidated
Financial Statements.

(G) LEASES
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies
to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS
116. Identification of a lease requires significant
judgement. The Group uses judgement in assessing
whether a contract (or part of contract) include
a lease, the lease term (including anticipated
renewals), the applicable discount rate, variable
lease payments whether are in-substance fixed.
The judgement involves assessment of whether
the asset included in the contract is a fully or
partly identified asset based on the facts and
circumstances, whether the contract include
a lease and non-lease component and if so,
separation thereof for the purpose of recognition
and measurement, determination of lease term
basis, inter alia the non-cancellable period of
lease and whether the lessee intends to opt for
continuing with the use of the asset upon the expiry
thereof, and whether the lease payments are fixed
are variable or a combination of both.

The Company has only one class of equity shares having face value of H 10 each. The holder of the equity share is entitled to
dividend right and voting right in the same proportion as the capital paid-up on such equity share bears to the total paid-up
equity share capital of the Company. The dividend proposed by Board of Directors is subject to approval of the shareholders in
the ensuing Annual General Meeting. In the event of liquidation of the Company, the holders of equity shares will be entitled to
receive the remaining assets of the Company in the same proportion as the capital paid-up on the equity shares held by them
bears to the total paid-up equity share capital of the Company.

The Company had issued 42,26,26,894 equity shares of face value of H 10/- each on right basis (‘Rights Equity Shares’). In
accordance with the terms of issue, H 314.25 i.e. 25% of the Issue Price per Rights Equity Share, was received from the concerned
allottees on application and shares were allotted. The Board had made First call of H 314.25 per Rights Equity Share (including a
premium of H 311.75 per share) in May, 2021 and  Second and Final call of H 628.50 per Rights Equity Share (including a premium
of H 623.50 per share) in November, 2021. During the year under review, 2,74,853 partly paid up shares became fully paid up
shares and 1,42,565 shares, on which an amount of H 4,31,315 was paid-up, were forfeited and cancelled.
14.8 Bonus Shares Issued During the Current Financial Year:
On October 29, 2024, the Company had allotted 676,61,86,449 bonus equity shares of H 10/- each (fully paid up) in the
proportion of 1 bonus equity share for every 1 fully paid up equity share to eligible shareholders whose names appeared in the
Register of Members / Register of Beneficial Owner as on October 28, 2024, being the record date fixed for this purpose, in
accordance with approval received from the Members by way of postal ballot, result of which was declared on October 16, 2024.
The said bonus equity shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing equity shares of the Company. As a result of the
bonus issue, the paid-up capital of the Company increased to H 13,532 crore from H 6,766 crore. The paid-up capital on account
of bonus issue of H 6,766 crore has been appropriated from securities premium.

The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition of Plan
Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group’s policy for Plan Assets Management.
VIII)	The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 2024‑25.
IX)	These plan’s typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and
Salary Risk.
Investment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined
by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.

Reconciliation of Fair Value of Assets and Obligations

Interest Risk

A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an
increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.

Longevity Risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of
the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.

Salary Risk

The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.

The reserve estimates for producing fields are revised based on the performance of producing fields and with respect to
discovered fields, the revision are based on the revised geological and reservoir simulation studies.
33.3	The Government of India (“GoI”), disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”), relating to Block
KG‑DWN-98/3 (“KG D6”) entitles the Company to recover. The Company maintains that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its
costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost. The
Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The matter is presently at the stage of Final Hearing as
part of arbitration proceedings. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million (for C 1,407 crore) being the Company’s share (total demand
$ 247 million – C 2,111 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability as on 31st March 2025.
		In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January 2014, the GOI notified the New
Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to instruct customers to
deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the guidelines converted to NCV
basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account maintained by
GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 crore (net) as at 31th March 2025. Revenue
has been recognised at the GoI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014.
This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.  
33.4 (a)	
Government of India (“GoI”) sent a demand notice to the KG D6 block contractor (RIL, BP Exploration (Alpha) Limited and
Niko (NECO) Limited) (together “Contractor”) on 3rd November 2016, on account of production of gas allegedly migrated
from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as operator and on behalf of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GoI. The
Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July 2018 (“Arbitration Award”), upheld Contractor’s claims. Vide Judgment
dated 9th May 2023, a single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration Award and dismissed GoI’s appeal
challenging the award. On an appeal by GOI, vide judgment dated 14th February 2025, the Division Bench of the Hon’ble
Delhi High Court allowed GoI’s appeal and set aside the judgment of the single judge and the Arbitration Award.
A demand letter dated 1st March 2025 for payment of $ 2.81 billion (RIL share $ 1.87 billion) was sent by GoI to the
Contractor. RIL, on 17th March 2025, responded that it is not liable to make any payment to GoI and that the demand letter
is without any factual or legal basis and is liable to be withdrawn. RIL will be filing an appeal against the judgement of the
Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court.

		(b)	
Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) against
GOI under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions
between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this matter, some
of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be issued.
The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in court
judgements that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour.
		(c)	
NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a period
of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses in the suit are to
be cross examined by NTPC. On 2nd December 2024, an SLP was filed by RIL before the Supreme Court against an Order of the
Bombay High Court in the NTPC suit, directing redaction of certain portions of RIL’s Affidavit. The matter is presently sub-judice.
		
Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure
to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration / litigations. Moreover, the
Company considers above demand / disputes as remote.

(III) On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice (“SCN”) inter alia to the
Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, then
a subsidiary of RIL. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) passed  directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL
from dealing in equity derivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year
from the date of the order; and (ii)  to disgorge from RIL an amount of H 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum
from November 29, 2007, till the date of payment On an appeal by RIL, Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) by a majority order (2:1),
dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020, and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the
order. The appeal of RIL and others has been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit H 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of
the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated
December 17, 2020, of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
In the above matter, the adjudicating officer of SEBI (“AO”) while adjudicating the show cause notice dated November 21, 2017 issued,
inter alia, to RIL passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of H 25 crore on RIL. In the appeal filed by RIL, the Hon’ble
Securities Appellate Tribunal vide order dated December 4, 2023, did not interfere with the order passed by the AO since the matter
was already covered by its earlier decision dated November 5, 2020, which is in appeal by RIL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  RIL
has filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against Order dated December 4, 2023 of SAT. The Company continues to
consider the aforesaid liability as contingent.
(IV) Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited has received Show Cause cum Demand notices (“SCNs”) from the Department of
Telecommunications (“DOT”), Government of India towards license fees aggregating to H 3,202 crore which includes penalty and
interest thereon (March 31, 2024: H 3,202 crore including penalty and interest). The Group has made representations to DOT contesting
the basis of such demands. Based on opinion of legal expert, the Group is confident that it has good grounds on merit to defend itself in
the above matter. Accordingly, the Group is of the view that no provision is necessary in respect of the aforesaid matter.
(V)

Den Networks Limited (“DEN”) has received demand of H 628 crore from the Department of Telecom (DOT) during provisional
assessment towards the license fees for the years 2010-11 to 2015-16 considering revenue from the cable business and other income
for the purpose of calculating AGR or license fees. Demand was initially raised on DEN. However, revised demand of H 2,157 crore
including interest and penalty calculated up till date has been raised on Den Broadband Limited (wholly owned subsidiary of DEN) for
the years 2011-2012 to 2015-2016. In view of management and based on legal opinion obtained, these demands are unenforceable.
DEN has filed various petitions before the Hon’ble TDSAT challenging these demands. In all the petitions, the Hon’ble TDSAT has
restrained DOT from taking any coercive measure for realisation of the demands.

Financial Risk Management
The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk),
commodity price risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework,
the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its
financial performance.
i)

Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as
equity price risk and commodity risk.

			a)

values of its financial instruments, principally debt. The Group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on
market opportunities and it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposures.
The exposure of the Group’s borrowings and derivatives to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting
period are as follows:

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due
causing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and
receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to
customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance
function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.

The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities.
Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group Guarantees,
advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group restricts its fixed
income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.

Total

Currency Swaps
Interest Rate Swaps

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local financial
markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding
from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flow
position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.
The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury
pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest
the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market
funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in
any one instrument or counterparty.

Hedge Accounting
The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other
feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has
adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge
accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded
futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this
objective.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a
hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative
method and Dollar offset method.
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
- Differences in the timing of the cash flows.
- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves).

Total consideration for (b) and (c) being H 44,437 crore (H 11,500 crore + H 32,937 crore).
The aforesaid resulted in SIPL becoming a 63.16 % subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. The Group derives synergies from SIPL’s
superior content, OTT Platform and brand recall to augment its presence in the media space. This transaction has been accounted for
by the Group in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 103 applicable to reverse acquisitions. Accordingly, the consideration
issued by the Group of H 44,437 crore, has been appropriated over identifiable assets and liabilities of SIPL, being non-current and
current assets of H 13,527 crore and H 24,866 crore respectively, non-current and current liabilities of H 679 crore and H 8,489 crore
respectively, recognition of onerous contract of H 22,129 crore, recognition of brand of H 31,513 crore, with the balancing figure being
goodwill of H 5,828 crore. This acquisition does not have a material impact on the consolidated revenue and consolidated profits of the
Group for the current year.
43. Events after the Reporting Period
The Board of Directors have recommended dividend of H 5.5/- per fully paid up equity share of H 10/- each for the financial year 202425 aggregating H 7,443 crore.
