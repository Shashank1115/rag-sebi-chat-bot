AI YOUR ENTERPRISE
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Building enterprises in the age of AI
Over the past two years, we’ve seen rapid growth in AI
awareness, usage, and investment. The hunger to learn fast
and experiment faster has been insatiable. With growing
ease of use and increasing access to AI assistants, co-pilots
and tools, AI use-cases and pilots have mushroomed and
burgeoned across the enterprise, with some value realized.
The unbridled enthusiasm around AI has meant that CXOs
are no longer having to advocate for the value of AI within
the enterprise. Instead, they can invest now in scaling,
driving adoption and governing.
The distinct opportunity is to build with AI to amplify the
potential of employees, and modernize systems and how
they empower people working within the organization,
to increase efficiency, productivity, and innovation. This in
turn can transform the value these businesses can bring
to their customers. By strategically implementing AI and
ensuring it complements human capabilities, businesses
can significantly improve customer proposition and
service, leading to increased satisfaction, loyalty, and
ultimately, better business outcomes.
This endeavor can be multi-tiered and complex. AI
experiments are often heterogeneous, requiring diverse
data and tech stacks that necessitate building entire new
architectural foundations before value can be realized.
There is also the need to focus on making sure that AI

systems are used fairly and responsibly so that they can
truly serve the enterprise at scale.
Applying AI at a scale that can power the entire
enterprise involves building AI capabilities mindfully. This
entails nurturing a robust data strategy, investing in AI
infrastructure optimization, while also systemically building
capacity to deepen algorithmic efficiencies and improve
model performance. In many ways, this is about reframing
the status quo for an AI-first future – with sustained value
in mind. Leaders embrace a hybrid approach to power their
AI flywheels. They need flexibility of infrastructure – both
rental and owned models – to bring them the control that
they need over the environment, along with the potential
to drive efficiencies in the long run, in addition to security
and compliance efficiencies as well.
We are building templates for AI success – industry after
industry, business after business – for enterprise-scale
value generation for our clients. We are helping them
AI their enterprise in ways that are changing the game
for them today and giving them a head start into the
future. Some interesting examples, as case studies, make
for interesting and quick reading later in this Integrated
Annual Report. In many ways, it’s exactly what you’d expect
from a partner whose promise to enterprises is – navigate
your next.

Americana Restaurants is the largest out-of-home
dining and quick-service restaurant operator in their 12
countries of operation across the Middle East and North
Africa. With strong franchisor partnerships and a diverse
portfolio of iconic global brands, including KFC, Pizza
Hut, Hardee’s, Krispy Kreme, Peet’s Coffee, Wimpy, TGI
Friday’s, Costa Coffee, and Baskin Robbins, the company
delivers world-class dining experiences. Their growth,
in recent years, has been so rapid that it was starting
to strain their technology infrastructure, exposing
limitations in their ability to scale to demand. They
sought out Infosys’ expertise to help them establish
a state-of-the-art BPM framework that would bring
transparency and efficiency into their process ecosystem
while prioritizing their vital enterprise Accounts Payable
processes for AI-powered transformation.
Infosys started at the foundation, completely
reimagining Americana Restaurants’ document-centric
workflows for an enterprise set to turn AI-first. The
deployment of Infosys Accounts Payable Solution on
the cloud and its application enterprise-wide ensured
that Americana Restaurants significantly improved
efficiency, reducing processing times, minimizing

errors, and optimizing costs. The integration of agentic
AI that followed has made their invoice processing
largely autonomous. AI agents process invoices endto-end and offer support for multiple languages while
managing complex validations and diverse expense
types and processing exceptions with minimal human
intervention. When required, users enjoy a highly
intuitive user interface that only requires them to access
a very simple training that serves them well across
devices, from desktops to mobiles.
Infosys’ agentic AI-powered cloud-based Accounts
Payable solution is among the first of its kind anywhere
in the world that empowers Americana Restaurants to:
•

Not only process invoices with minimal human
intervention but predict and plan for future
transactions

•

Adapt the accounts payable environment
dynamically to process deviations, reduce errors,
and increase accuracy

•

Leverage Microsoft Azure GPT-4 Omni for
continuous learning and operational improvements

“Our partnership with Infosys has helped us embrace enterprise AI and transform
the way we manage finance operations. With AI, our invoice processing is faster,
more accurate, and far more future-proofed. This leap forward has also meant
bringing more intelligence into our Accounts Payable, and we are looking to apply
that learning into other areas of our organization.”
– Harsh Bansal, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Growth Officer, Americana Restaurants

Performance overview

Chairman’s message
An era of uncertainty
As we contemplate the developments of the last few
months, we know we are in an era of uncertainty that
we have never seen before. Multiple trends are colliding
and leading us to reexamine the fundamentals of our
businesses.
As geopolitics becomes front and centre in our lives, we are
having to take cognizance of the world not as one single
global market but as fragmented blocs and countries.
This means making strategic choices and even navigating
between these blocs. COVID brought into focus the critical
and pressing need to derisk our supply chain and build
viable alternatives. It was no longer enough to deliver
just-in-time; we had to also factor in for just-in-case. Now
tariffs are further driving home the point that we need to
diversify our sourcing. Tariffs will be differentiated across
products and countries and will likely keep changing.
Bilateral and regional rules of trade will dominate. Supply
chains will continue to shift as tariffs become another form
of arbitrage.
The advent of AI with all its possibilities and potential
creates another arc of uncertainty. As enterprises look
at applying AI to every aspect of the business, some
longstanding challenges will become imperative and
self-evident to firms. For example, the need to modernize
legacy systems, and the need to create data architecture
so that all the firm’s data is consumable by AI, in a holistic
manner, can no longer be put off. Firms will need to have
an AI foundry for rapid innovation and an AI factory to
scale successful innovations across the enterprise. While
embracing AI will bring a goldmine of opportunities, it will
not be entirely without some foreseeable risks. Regulatory
variances across regions will need to be incorporated
into one’s strategy. The early learnings from enterprise AI
adoption gives us a glimpse of these potential challenges
that lie on the path ahead.

Nandan M. Nilekani

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Climate change and the associated energy transition adds
to the crucible of uncertainties. So much of the future
depends on innovation and the form of energy that will
fuel us forward – solar, wind, batteries, pumped hydro,
green hydrogen, nuclear, carbon capture and storage, etc.
Global climate deals will set the pace of change. The only
thing certain is that electricity will play a much bigger
role in the days ahead. And the pace of its rollout will be
contingent on building new transmission lines, setting up
charging stations, and acquiring more transformers. This
transformation will naturally be constrained by regulatory
cholesterol. The price of various commodities will rise,
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

and fall based on the speed of transition. And many assets
could well be stranded.
Every business vertical is facing challenges of various kinds.
Car makers are dealing with the transition from ICE engines
to batteries. Pharma companies are looking at accelerating
the pace of drug discovery with AI. Logistics companies
are dealing with the complete reordering of global supply
chains. Financial service companies are considering
the tokenization of their assets. Energy companies are
assessing the long-term demand for their products. Utilities
are facing a distributed future. Manufacturing companies
are navigating the advent of robots and 3D printing.
Service companies are dealing with AI agents performing
their tasks. There is not a sector that remains unscathed
as rapid business and technological disruption forces
businesses to adapt and advance.
Amid these growing uncertainties, there is a certainty that
Infosys brings, that is of immense value to enterprises.
The Infosys basket of products and services is diversified
across geographies, verticals and technologies with
solutions to both traditional and emerging business
challenges. These solutions are created to support clients’
investments in growth as well as for when they are cutting
back on costs. Infosys is differentiated by its continuous
and active investments in nurturing an engaged and
committed workforce. A big part of this investment is in
creating flexible training and skilling capability so that
this workforce is always abreast of changing technology
and business practices. There is also a relentless focus on
productivity, so business investments work harder. Even
as Infosys strives to be a truly AI-first company, there is a
simultaneous and equal focus on being at the forefront of
sustainability. In every way, we seek to continue to rank
among the world’s most respected companies.
We’ve always believed in enthusiastically embracing
change. After all, our brand’s promise to our stakeholders
is to help them navigate their next. We also have immense
confidence stemming from our fortress balance sheet –
characterized by high liquidity, zero debt, and the ability
to withstand uncertainty. Above all, at Infosys, we remain
fully aligned on strategy, yet tactically agile, having high
mutual trust and responsiveness to customers, investors
and employee needs.
So many things have changed. Then again, some things
remain unchanged.

Letter to the Shareholder
Dear shareholder,
Financial year 2025 was another year of strong execution
for Infosys. We had growth of 4.2%, operating margin of
21.1%, and free cash flow of US$4.1 billion. We announced
a total dividend of `43 per share (including an interim
dividend of `21 per share).

During the year, Infosys was recognized as a top 100 most
valuable brand in the world and ranked among the most
trusted brands in the US, by Kantar BrandZ. For the fifth
consecutive year, we were recognized as one of the World’s
Most Ethical Companies.

Infosys is the leader in AI, cloud, data, and digital for our
clients.

We recruited over 15,000 college graduates in the year and
ended the year with over 3,20,000 employees. 39% of our
workforce are women employees.

Infosys Topaz brings the power of AI, with a strong
foundation of cloud and data, to help our clients leverage
the next generation of opportunities. To help our clients
with AI, we have built a repository of AI agents. These
agents improve productivity in areas such as code
generation, IT operations, bill-to-cash, and quote-to-order.
We have developed domain-specific language models
for some industries, IT operations, and cybersecurity. As a
result of our expertise and strong partnership with industry
leaders, we are now offering model development as a
service to our customers.
Our Cobalt cloud capabilities provide the foundation for
AI. We are working with the leading public cloud providers,
private cloud players, SaaS companies, and PaaS platforms.
Data is another foundational element for AI. Our
capabilities in data architecture and managing structured
and unstructured data give our clients confidence to use
their data for enterprise AI deployment.
Our expertise across enterprise solutions, engineering
services, cybersecurity, applications, infrastructure, and
operations continues to drive value creation for our clients.
We have continued our focus on cost efficiency,
automation, lean, and delivering productivity
improvements for our clients.
With our deep expertise across AI, cloud, data, digital, and
cost efficiency offerings, we are well-established as the
preferred partner for large enterprises across the world.

The Infosys Foundation continues to create positive impact
by supporting the communities we work with, in the areas
of healthcare, education, women empowerment, and
sustainability. Over the year, the Foundation impacted
over 1 crore lives through its outreach programs. Infosys
Springboard, our free skilling platform, is helping build
digital skills globally and has already provided free learning
programs to 9.2 million people around the world.
Our client relationships have been the foundation of
success through the years. We thank our clients for their
continued trust and partnership.
We value the enormous contribution of our over 3,20,000
employees for making our clients successful. Their
dedication and continued pursuit of excellence have
enabled sustained value creation for our clients.
Thanks to our Board for their guidance and support for our
strategic direction.
As technology continues to be more central in the world,
Infosys becomes more relevant to our clients.
I remain optimistic about the enormous opportunities we
have for the future.
With my warmest regards,
Sd/Bengaluru

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Technology continues to transform
businesses in every industry
around the world in a profound
and fundamental way. In fiscal
2025, AI, including agentic AI,
generative AI, 5G, Low Code No
Code and quantum computing
shaped the future of industries.
From new AI architectures like
small language models and multiagents to precision manufacturing,
this year, we are tackling some
of the hardest challenges across
industries by building strong
data foundations with robust
cloud capabilities. Responsible
business approaches, including
embracing Environmental, Social
and Governance (ESG), continue
to gain traction. We continued to
witness businesses attempting to
reimagine their cost structures,
increase business resilience and
agility, personalize experiences
for customers and employees,
and launch new and disruptive
products and services. Enterprises are
leveraging AI to extend the value of
existing investments and, in parallel,
transform and future-proof their
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

business. The need for professionals
who are highly skilled in both
traditional and digital technology
areas is driving businesses to
build strategic technology and
IT partnerships to realize their
transformation journeys.
We see AI across industries finetune the necessities of specialized
domains and tasks. Firms globally are
racing to support AI agents and we
are on the path to enabling them.
Agents are expected to drive the next
wave of monetization of AI. Central
to this shift of AI agents is the agenda
to build intelligent systems that are
capable of doing tasks with multiple
steps, autonomous interactions
with tools and data and automating
business workflows.
The future of the technology industry
continues to be shaped by the
following trends:
• Focus on enterprise AI capabilities
• Demand for IT services with
growth pockets emerging in areas
like cloud, cybersecurity, IoT and
immersive technologies.

• Focus on cost takeouts to
deal with the uncertain global
environment.
• Increase in enterprise spending
on hybrid, multi-cloud / AI-led
transformation.
• Intense competition for talent as
enterprises embrace new ways
of working amid scarcity of niche
digital skills.
• Continued focus on ESG as a
strategic theme for all enterprise
stakeholders.
Intense competition marks the
delivery of traditional services in
a rapidly changing marketplace,
especially with the emergence of
new players in niche technology
areas. Infosys’ industry expertise,
end‑to-end service capability and
digital solutions, ability to scale,
established platforms, superior
quality and process execution,
distributed agile global delivery
model, experienced management
team, talented professionals and
track record are often cited as clear
differentiators.

enhanced with generative AI aspects.

Expand localization

needs of our clients, we prioritize:

Decades before climate change emerged as a global boardroom
priority, Infosys had recognized that natural capital is integral
to long-term value creation. Our approach to managing
environmental impact is holistic, scientific, and anchored in
responsible growth. We have pledged to maintain carbon neutrality
across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Our commitment goes beyond
compliance – it is about leading by example and setting new
standards in corporate climate responsibility.

We are now evolving from carbon neutrality to climate
positivity – investing in regenerative practices, naturebased solutions, and green innovation to restore
ecosystems and capture more carbon than we emit.
Our commitment is not just to reduce harm, but to
create lasting environmental value.

Our 3-pillar strategy
to climate action

To operationalize our climate
ambitions, we have built a robust
strategy anchored on three pillars –
energy efficiency, renewable energy,
and carbon offsets.

1. Energy efficiency
A culture of conscious
consumption
Infosys has been a pioneer in energyefficient infrastructure. Our campuses
are equipped with cutting-edge
technologies, such as radiant cooling
systems and intelligent building
designs. Over the past 15 years, we
have implemented one of the world’s
largest enterprise-level energy
conservation programs, significantly
reducing our energy intensity.
Today, we operate over 29.7 million
sq.ft. of workspace certified to the
highest levels of green building
standards. This is not just about
infrastructure – it’s about cultivating
a culture where efficiency and
sustainability go hand in hand.

2. Renewable energy
Accelerating clean transition
We have installed over 60 MW of
solar photovoltaic capacity through
rooftop and ground-mounted
systems. In addition to generating
clean energy onsite, we procure
renewable power through third-party
power purchase agreements and
green tariff mechanisms from utility
providers.
This comprehensive approach
enables us to avoid emissions while
supporting the larger shift towards
decarbonized energy systems.

3. Carbon offsets
Creating impact beyond the
organization
We address unavoidable emissions
through community-centric carbon
offset programs. Our projects are
verified by the Gold Standard for their
social and environmental impact.
These projects include clean cook
stove programs in Rajasthan and
the distribution of biogas units in
Maharashtra and Karnataka.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

To date, our carbon offset initiatives
have benefited over 2,72,000 rural
families and created more than 3,900
local jobs. We see these efforts not
only as a way to meet our climate
goals but also as an opportunity to
uplift communities and improve lives.

Water stewardship:
Conserving a vital resource
Water management has long been
a cornerstone of our environmental
strategy. As a signatory to the CEO
Water Mandate, we are committed
to minimizing water consumption
and maximizing reuse. Our efforts
continue to focus on improving water
availability in the communities where
we operate.
Our campuses recycle 100% of
wastewater and have effective
rainwater harvesting techniques
for utilizing rainwater effectively.
These initiatives, combined with
demand side measures, have helped
us minimize our water consumption
and reduce dependency on external
water sources. Our Bengaluru campus
is certified water positive by CII
based on NITI Aayog water neutrality
guidelines.

Lake rejuvenation: Restoring
ecosystems, supporting
communities
We are extending our water
stewardship efforts beyond our
campuses through lake rejuvenation
projects. Our goal is to increase
water-holding capacity by over 10
billion liters over five years. Infosys
is working with local partners to
improve water availability in the
communities in which Infosys
operates. In two years, we have
achieved an increase of 4.3 billion
liters in water holding capacity
through 11 lake rejuvenation projects
across India.
Read more in our ESG Report 2025.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Waste management: Towards
a circular economy
At Infosys, our waste strategy
is grounded in the principles of
reduction, recovery, and reuse. We
are steadily advancing towards
our goal of zero waste to landfills.
Organic waste, which accounts for
approximately 75% of our total
waste, is treated entirely onsite
through composting and recycling
mechanisms.
Our progress is aligned with the TRUE
zero waste certification framework,
reflecting our commitment to
transparency and best-in-class waste
management. Three of our campuses
have received TRUE certification for
zero waste.

Biodiversity: Breathing life
into our campuses
We are focused on strengthening
our efforts to preserve biodiversity
and improve green cover at all our
campuses. Our Mangaluru campus
biodiversity book was launched
online recently. The book highlights
endemic species of the Western
Ghats and offers a practical blueprint
for others aiming to undertake
similar initiatives in preserving
biodiversity. Through this effort, we
hope to inspire corporates, urban
planners, and communities to make
biodiversity a central consideration in
shaping the spaces we live in and use.

ASSURE
Infosys has long led the way in
sustainable, high-performance
buildings, and with ASSURE
(Accelerating Sustainable SuperEfficient Real Estate), we are taking
this impact to a national scale.
Launched in partnership with
the Indian Institute for Human
Settlements (IIHS) on April 30, 2024,
ASSURE is a multi-stakeholder
platform that positions our campuses

as living case studies, enabling
the replication of climate-resilient,
energy-efficient infrastructure.
The initiative brings together
global experts, policymakers, and
industry leaders to shape a future
where India’s buildings are radically
more sustainable. With a goal of
demonstrating 100 million sq.ft. of
super-efficient commercial real estate
by 2030, ASSURE focuses on sectors
with the highest energy and emission
intensity. The ASSURE program
will provide technical support to
developers, skill and upskill 12,000
individuals, back 30 innovators, and
advance performance measurement,
policy, and financing mechanisms
– all building on our own journey of
saving over US$250 million through
high-performance buildings.

Climate positivity: The next
frontier
As we progress toward environmental
stewardship, we are evolving from
climate neutrality towards climate
positivity – a paradigm where our
actions go beyond neutralizing
emissions to actively creating a net
environmental benefit. Climate
positivity includes investing in
regenerative practices and green
innovations that restore ecosystems,
sequestering more carbon than we
emit, and strengthening the planet’s
resilience. At Infosys, we see this
as a natural extension of our longstanding sustainability ethos. By
embedding climate-positive thinking
into our operations, products, and
community programs, we aim to
redefine what corporate climate
leadership looks like in the coming
decades. It’s not just about doing less
harm, but about doing more good.
As we look to the future, we remain
committed to being a catalyst
for positive change, proving that
sustainable development is not just
possible – it is essential.

Our Manufactured Capital includes our energy-efficient offices,
data centers, innovation hubs, digital studios, and our technology
infrastructure across the globe. Our infrastructure is modeled
taking into consideration stakeholder expectations of our
commitments towards climate change mitigation, judicious use
of natural resources and preserving our environment.

With the highest-rated green buildings on our
campuses and investments in collaborative tech
infrastructure, we offer productive, safe, healthy
and hybrid workplaces for our employees. We
continue to push the boundaries and define new
benchmarks in environmental sustainability.

Pushing the boundaries of
energy efficiency
For a sustainable future, pushing
the boundaries of energy efficiency
in buildings is essential. Innovative
design, advanced insulation, smart
HVAC systems, and renewable
energy integration are redefining
possibilities. High-performance
materials, passive solar techniques,
and real-time energy monitoring
reduce consumption and
environmental impact. Net-zero and
even energy-positive buildings are
becoming viable goals. Emphasizing
occupant comfort and health while
minimizing resource use reflects
a holistic approach to design. As
technology evolves and awareness
grows, we drive the ecosystem
players – architects, engineers, and
policymakers – to further stretch the
limits of energy efficiency.
An integrated approach to design,
implementation of innovative

technologies, and continuous
performance monitoring and
optimization have resulted in office
buildings with an estimated Energy
Performance Index (EPI) of lower
than 65 kWh/sq.m. per annum. Every
aspect of a building – from insulation
to high-performance glass and
shading, efficient mechanical and
electrical systems to high-efficiency
equipment with variable speed,
building management system to
granular performance monitoring
of individual equipment – has been
thoroughly studied for improvement
in every new building that we design
and construct across Infosys.
The lush green campuses of
Infosys, equipped with world-class
infrastructure, provides a unique
experience for our employees.
With about 29.7 million sq.ft.
of the highest level of green
building certification, Infosys’
leadership in high-performance
buildings remains unrivaled. Our

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

efforts include developing superefficient new buildings, retrofitting
existing buildings, a sharp focus
on innovation and continuous
monitoring to achieve the highest
levels of efficiency. Infosys’ building
standards have set new global
benchmarks.

Embodied carbon as an
essential benchmark
As a key stakeholder in the built
environment, we recognize the
urgent need to address embodied
carbon – the emissions associated
with building materials and
construction processes. While
operational efficiency has advanced,
embodied carbon remains a
significant contributor to climate
impact. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
is a critical tool for understanding
and reducing these emissions,
guiding smarter material choices
and sustainable design strategies. By
integrating LCA early in the design
process, we can make informed
decisions that align with climate
goals. Leadership today means
not only building efficiently, but
responsibly, reducing embodied
carbon to shape a resilient, lowcarbon future.
LCA has been an essential indicator
for all our new buildings in fiscal
2025. The LCA of our office buildings
have been estimated in the range of
650 – 900 kg CO2e/sq.m.

Green IT
InfosysIT has embedded sustainable
practices across the life cycles of
service design, operations, and
disposal of IT assets.

Data center efficiency
InfosysIT has taken up data center
modernization as a strategic initiative.
Density‑optimized hyperscale

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

platforms, which provide cloud-scale
agility and enable efficient resource
use, have been deployed to deliver
high-density server virtualization
and consolidation across the
enterprise. This initiative has
delivered significant power savings.
Subsequently, data center and server
rooms across development centers
were consolidated which resulted in a
reduction of over 600 KW of electrical
load in FY25.
InfosysIT continues to make
focused investments in Data Center
Infrastructure Management (DCIM)
tools to get accurate visibility across
the entire data center IT and Facility
stack for continuous optimization
and further consolidation.

Infrastructure as code
Infrastructure as code is a
transformational initiative towards
enabling continuous deployment,
continuous integration, and touchless management of the life cycle
of infrastructure components.
This methodology overcomes the
traditional challenges such as growing
scale of infrastructure, elastic demand,
speed and consistency of deployment
and interdependence between teams.
This initiative delivered significant
number of playbooks for automating
platform‑related processes across
hybrid cloud.

AIOps-powered digital operations
InfosysIT has implemented an
advanced AIOps platform equipped
with a broad range of capabilities,
including algorithmic noise reduction
and context-aware notifications.
The digital operations suite delivers
unified observability across both
infrastructure and application
layers, while also providing insights
into capacity utilization and cost
efficiency. It is designed to ingest
and process large volumes of data

from diverse sources within the IT
ecosystem. Leveraging AI, machine
learning (ML), and deep learning (DL)
algorithms, the platform identifies
opportunities for remediation and
optimization, driving operational
excellence.

Public cloud adoption
Majority of internal IT applications
have been moved to public cloud
infrastructure. All our employees
have been enabled for cloudbased collaboration for messaging,
presence, video, and other
requirements. Additionally, cloudbased unified internet access and
secure private access has enhanced
hybrid work experience.
The shift to cloud has helped in
optimizing the on-premises data
center footprint and also to scale up
the infra on demand and provision
IT services seamlessly for all the new
hires inducted into the organization.

Impactful workplace
design
Infosys continued on its workplace
transformation journey, to adapt to
the hybrid future-ready scenario.
The principles of Infosys workplace
strategy are focused on productivity,
social connect, use of tech, health
and wellness, sustainability and
design for all. These are being
followed in all new workplace
designs of Infosys.
The new workplace designs align
space with purpose, empowering
people and teams to perform their
best. We believe as work continues
to evolve, so must our environments,
making reimagined workplace design
a catalyst for culture, innovation and
long-term resilience.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Capital Allocation Policy
"Effective from financial year 2025, the Company expects to
continue its policy of returning approximately 85% of the
free cash flow cumulatively over a five-year period through a
combination of semi-annual dividends and / or share buyback
/ special dividends, subject to applicable laws and requisite
approvals, if any." Under this policy, the Company expects to
progressively increase its annual dividend per share (excluding
special dividend, if any). Free cash flow is defined as net cash
provided by operating activities less capital expenditure as per
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under IFRS.
Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company paid
an interim dividend of ₹21 per equity share and announced
a final dividend of ₹22 per share, subject to shareholders’
approval in the ensuing Annual General Meeting (AGM).
Including the final dividend declared above, the Company has
returned approximately `17,814 crore, which is 51.6% of the
free cash flow for fiscal 2025 through dividends, in line with the
Capital Allocation Policy.
The Capital Allocation Policy is available on our website, at
https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/
documents/capital-allocation-policy.pdf.

Liquidity
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents,
investments and the cash flow that we generate from our
operations. We continue to be debt-free and maintain sufficient
cash to meet our strategic and operational requirements. We
understand that liquidity in the Balance Sheet has to balance
between earning adequate returns and the need to cover
financial and business requirements. Liquidity enables us to be
agile and ready for meeting unforeseen strategic and business
needs and opportunities.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

As of March 31, 2025, we had ₹45,406 crore in working capital on
a standalone basis, and ₹54,249 crore on a consolidated basis.
Consolidated cash and investments stand at `35,916 crore on a
standalone basis and ₹47,549 crore on a consolidated basis as on
March 31, 2025, as against ₹30,579 crore on a standalone basis,
and ₹39,005 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2024.
Consolidated cash and investments, on both standalone and
consolidated basis, include deposits with banks with high credit
ratings by international and domestic credit rating agencies.
As a result, liquidity risk of cash and cash equivalents is limited.
Ratings are monitored periodically. Liquid assets also include
investments in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity funds
units, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), Commercial Paper (CP),
quoted bonds and securities issued by government and quasigovernment organizations, and non-convertible debentures. CDs
and CPs represent marketable securities of banks, Non-Banking
Financial Companies (NBFCs) and eligible financial institutions for
a specified time period with high credit rating given by domestic
credit rating agencies. Government securities are highly liquid
and marketable instruments issued across tenure, backed by the
Government of India carrying a sovereign credit. Investments
made in non-convertible debentures are issued by governmentowned institutions and financial institutions with high credit
rating. We invest after considering counterparty risks based on
multiple criteria including Tier-I capital, capital adequacy ratio,
credit rating, profitability, Non Performing Asset (NPA) levels and
deposit base of banks and financial institutions.
The details of these investments are disclosed under
the ‘non-current and current investments’ section in the
Standalone and Consolidated financial statements in this
Integrated Annual Report.

resources management focuses on allowing our employees to
develop their skills, grow in their career and navigate their next.

Resolution hubs
Infosys’ unwavering commitment has always been to foster
an open, inclusive and safe workplace where every employee
can thrive. The organization’s goal is to ensure that employees,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or any other
distinguishing factors, feel empowered to contribute to the
best of their abilities. In line with this, we encourage an opendoor policy that allows employees to voice their concerns and
seek support through Resolution hubs comprising Hearing
Employees and Resolving (HEAR) for workplace-related issues and
Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative (ASHI) for sexual harassment
complaints. Our forums include a well-established and robust
grievance resolution mechanism.
Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of natural justice,
ensure confidentiality, and non-retaliation while addressing
concerns. The concerns are handled with utmost sensitivity
and are redressed in a time-bound manner. A detailed
investigation is conducted to ensure fairness and provide
an opportunity to present facts and any material evidence
pertaining to the grievance.
Our ASHI initiative has set an industry benchmark, being
ranked first among 350+ companies that participated in an
external survey on the best anti-sexual harassment initiatives
in 2017 and 2019-2024.
Infosys has constituted an Internal Committee (IC) in all the
development centers of the Company in India to consider and
resolve all sexual harassment complaints reported by women.
The IC has been constituted as per the Sexual Harassment of
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal)
Act, 2013, and the committee includes external members from
non-governmental organizations or with relevant experience.
Investigations are conducted and decisions made by the IC at
the respective locations, with a senior female employee serving

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

as the presiding officer in each case. Half of the total members
of the IC are women. The role of the IC is not restricted to mere
redressal of complaints but also encompasses prevention and
prohibition of sexual harassment. In the last few years, the IC
has worked extensively on creating awareness on relevance of
sexual harassment issues in the new normal by using new and
innovative measures to help employees understand the forms of
sexual harassment while working remotely. The details of sexual
harassment complaints that were filed, resolved and pending
during the financial year are provided in the Business Responsibility

Board evaluation

Board diversity

diverse Board in its success. We believe that a truly diverse Board
will leverage differences in thought, perspective, regional and
industry experience, cultural and geographical background,
age, ethnicity, race, gender, knowledge and skills, including
expertise in financial, diversity, global business, leadership,
information technology, mergers and acquisitions, Board service
and governance, sales and marketing, Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG), risk management and cybersecurity and other
domains, which will ensure that Infosys retains its competitive
advantage. The Board Diversity Policy adopted by the Board sets
out its approach to diversity.

We affirm that the remuneration paid to the directors is as
per the terms laid out in the Nomination and Remuneration
Policy of the Company.
The Company has received necessary declaration from
each independent director that he / she meets the criteria
of independence laid down in Section 149(6), Code for

4. Executive summary along with web-link(s) of Impact Assessment of CSR Projects carried out in pursuance of subrule (3) of rule 8, if applicable:
The Company has been implementing various CSR projects for holistic community development and institution building to serve the
enrichment and evolution of businesses and communities. For fiscal 2025, the Company has engaged an external agency to provide
support and assistance for an independent review and impact assessment.
Methodology:
In order to assess the impact of its CSR projects, a mixed-method approach was deployed which involved either one of or both the
quantitative and qualitative research tools (as relevant) for primary data collection. Using these tools, the team conducted interactions
(virtual and on-field) with the project beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholders. Post data collection and analysis, the key insights
and findings were collated in the form of a consolidated report for the Management’s consideration. This study was guided by
the Inclusiveness, Relevance, Effectiveness, Convergence and Sustainability (IRECS) Framework which was used to provide overall
feedback on the efficacy of implementation as well, as its efficiency in terms of achievement of the desired project outputs with
reference to inputs.
Summary:
During the year, impact assessment study was conducted on 26 eligible CSR projects which impacted 1.3 crore beneficiaries across
various states in India. These projects align with the ESG framework and support 13 of the UN SDG goals which cover the broad themes
of education, healthcare, women empowerment, sustainability and others.

Annexure 7 – Conservation of energy, research and development, technology
absorption, foreign exchange earnings and outgo.
[Particulars pursuant to the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014]
Our focused approach on energy efficiency, renewable energy
and carbon offset projects over the years resulted in the
Company achieving carbon neutrality for six years in a row
since fiscal 2020, across all emissions. As we continue to remain
carbon neutral for fiscal 2025, we have started to work towards
climate positivity, aiming to restore more than we consume
and to contribute actively to the health of our ecosystems and
communities. We are thereby increasing our efforts in the global
response to the threat of climate change.

Resource conservation initiatives
Resource conservation initiatives at Infosys have been
focused, continuous and imbibed in our operations and new
infrastructure development. The introduction of highly efficient
new buildings, major improvements in existing buildings,
intelligent automation, water management plans, and waste
treatment and management projects have significantly reduced
our environmental impact.
The increased adoption of renewable energy in our operations
has helped avoid emissions significantly, and our highimpact carbon offset projects have enabled us to offset
unavoidable emissions.
Energy: Infosys has demonstrated a strong commitment to
energy conservation through a series of initiatives to improve
operational efficiency and reduce overall consumption through
cutting edge building designs, operational optimization and
employee engagement. By combining innovative technologies
with operational discipline, we have consistently reduced
our energy intensity year after year. These efforts underscore
Infosys’ belief that systematic, technology-driven conservation
strategies are crucial to achieving meaningful progress towards
sustainability goals. In fiscal 2025, while our new buildings were
designed to new energy efficiency benchmarks, about `10.7
crore was spent on retrofits in some of our older infrastructure to
improve operational efficiency.
In an effort to replicate the success of high-efficiency building
design and operations on a larger scale, Infosys launched a
unique initiative ‘ASSURE’ (Accelerating Sustainable and Superefficient Real Estate) in partnership with the Indian Institute
for Human Settlements. ASSURE has a vision of accelerating
decarbonization in the Indian building sector, by creating
lighthouse projects, skilling students and practitioners, advocacy
and other activities involving various stakeholders in the
ecosystem. Our leadership is expected to drive a transformative
shift towards climate-resilient buildings and align urban growth
with India’s broader goals under the Paris Agreement and
contribute to a low-carbon future.

94

Renewable energy: Infosys has a total installed solar capacity
of 60 MW across campuses including, a 40 MW captive solar
plant in Karnataka. Additionally, the Company leverages Power
Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green tariffs to expand its clean
energy portfolio. Infosys is steadily reducing its dependence
on fossil fuels and accelerating the shift to a low-carbon future.
In fiscal 2025, 77.7% of our electricity in India operations was
met through renewables.
Green buildings: All new developments are designed to achieve
the highest level of green building certification, with about 29.7
million square feet of Infosys’ operational space already certified.
Reinforcing Infosys’ commitment to energy efficiency, resource
conservation and low-carbon operations.
Smarter spaces: Infosys is reimagining the future workplace
through its “workplace transformation” initiative, aligning
office design with hybrid work models and sustainability goals.
Next generation offices are digitally connected, ergonomically
designed, and powered by intelligent energy systems that
adapt to real-time usage. Building Management Systems (BMS)
optimize lighting, ventilation, and cooling to minimize energy
waste. By promoting flexible working practices and creating
energy-efficient, human-centered environments, we are
enhancing employee well-being while significantly reducing our
operational footprint.
Water management: Committed to climate-positive goals, the
Company ensures zero wastewater discharge, has endorsed the
UN CEO Water Mandate, and aims to recharge more water than
it consumes by 2030. Our efforts include demand reduction
measures, wastewater recycling and rainwater harvesting
initiatives. We have also implemented lake rejuvenation
projects for larger community impact. Additionally, we are also
sensitizing our employees on environmental protection and
working with local stakeholders to improve water security to
set industry benchmarks while addressing operational and
ecological resilience.
Waste management: We are aiming for zero waste to landfill
while aligning with sustainability goals such as the GRI 306
and Scope 3 emissions standards. Infosys adopts the principles
of circular economy to minimize environmental impact.
Key initiatives around segregation, effective treatment and
management have resulted in achieving over 98% waste
diversion from landfill in fiscal 2025. Three of our campuses have
achieved TRUE certification for zero waste by the Green Business
Certification Institute.
Carbon offset: Infosys addresses unavoidable emissions
through community-based carbon offset projects. Projects
in the clean cooking space implemented in four states
across India have improved livelihoods and helped generate
income for rural women.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

We are also implementing large-scale carbon sequestration
projects through nature-based solutions, including agroforestry
initiatives. These projects go beyond environmental benefits,
positively impacting small and marginal farmers by improving
soil health, food security, and climate resilience.

legacy on-premises platforms to scalable, faster, and efficient
hybrid and cloud-based solutions. This supports modern
management, fosters innovation, improves user experience, and
ensures data security.

Carbon neutral events: Infosys is committed to hosting carbon
neutral events as part of its broader climate action strategy.
Infosys ensures that all event-related emissions are carefully
measured, minimized, and offset through certified projects.
This approach not only reinforces the Company’s pledge toward
climate positivity, but also demonstrates Infosys’ intent to
extend our sustainability practices to external-facing events
as well. In fiscal 2025, eight events organized by Infosys were
declared carbon neutral.

Energy efficient IT infrastructure

Health, Safety and Environment
Our Health, Safety, and Environmental Management System
(HSEMS) reflects our commitment to creating a safe, healthy,
and sustainable workplace for employees, contractors, and
visitors alike. Aligned with our broader climate and sustainability
goals, Infosys is certified to ISO 14001:2015 for Environmental
Management and ISO 45001:2018 for Occupational Health
and Safety. The HSEMS is built on a strong framework of
compliance, taking into account the needs of all stakeholders
and ensuring adherence to applicable laws across all
regions where we operate.

Technology absorption
Live Enterprise@Infosys: An enterprise that senses, feels
and responds in real-time – this has been the theme of our
transformation journey in the recent years. We have used a
mobile-first approach so that employees are connected to the
organization wherever they are and can access the organization’s
resources to learn and contribute. The response has been
phenomenal as over 2,50,000 unique users use InfyMe mobile
app every month for its 300+ features and more than 77,000
users have rated it 4.6/5 on the Google Play Store. With process
bursting, we have seen many of our key processes become
faster and more responsive. Following the overwhelming
success in Infosys, we are also seeing interest of the Orbit
platform (InfyMe version for our clients) and have more than
12 clients using the same.
Modern, hybrid, and secure workplace: Our hybrid workplace
uses borderless ODCs, virtual collaboration tools, and selfservice applications to enable employees to work from
anywhere. Our IT management system protects data and our
brand by continuously assessing vulnerabilities. Collaborative
tools foster innovation and teamwork. Employees are enabled
with AI-powered systems and tools to enhance productivity
and decision-making, allowing the automation of repetitive
tasks and improving customer experience. The cloud-first
approach has helped in migrating our key security tools from

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our network
and computer workload energy-efficient and environmentfriendly. Some of the measures implemented are:
Energy efficient network infrastructure: InfosysIT uses network
gears with power saving features to enhance energy efficiency.
Public cloud adoption: Majority of internal IT applications have
been moved to public cloud infrastructure. All our employees
have been enabled for cloud-based collaboration for messaging,
presence, video, and other requirements. In addition, cloudbased unified internet access and secure private access has
improved hybrid work experience.
The shift to cloud has helped in optimizing the on-premises data
center footprint and also to scale up the infra on demand and
provision IT services seamlessly for all the new hires inducted
into the organization.
Data center modernization: A strategic initiative launched by
InfosysIT to modernize the data center IT landscape to make it
future-ready continues to yield high rewards. Density-optimized
hyperscale platforms were deployed to enable high-density
server virtualization and consolidation across the enterprise.
Hyperscale platforms are open-source driven infrastructure
innovations that enable cloud-scale agility and efficient
resource pooling and utilization. This initiative is delivering
significant power savings and reduce the total cost of ownership
for the organization.
InfosysIT has invested on the Data Center Infrastructure
Management (DCIM) tool to get accurate visibility across the
entire data centre IT and facility stack, which is the foundation for
optimization initiatives.
Enterprise storage: The internal IT team provides all our delivery
units with multi-protocol storage using flash, fabric pool
and storage grid technology, which is a highly efficient and
innovative approach to managing storage capacity. This not only
saves data center footprint, but also reduces power consumption
and cooling requirements, leading to overall operational savings.
Hybrid cloud storage is also used for some workloads with builtin data protection and seamless scaling, eliminating the need for
buffer investments and achieving savings over on-premises data
center space, power consumption and cooling.
Cloud-native development environment: The open source-based
cloud-native development platform is built on Hyper Converged
Infrastructure (HCI) and compute, which has helped reduce data
center footprint, power and cooling consumption.

Statutory reports

Management’s discussion and analysis
Overview
Infosys is a leading provider of consulting, technology,
outsourcing and next-generation digital services, enabling
clients to create and execute strategies for their digital
transformation and AI journey.
Our purpose is to amplify human potential and create the next
opportunity for people, business and communities. We are
guided by our value system which motivates our attitudes and
actions. Our core values are Client value, Leadership by example,
Integrity and transparency, Fairness, and Excellence (C-LIFE).
Our strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization
that remains relevant to the agenda of our clients, while
creating growth opportunities for our employees, generating
profitable growth for our investors and contributing to the
communities that we operate in. There are numerous risks and
challenges affecting our business. These are discussed in the Risk
management report section of the Integrated Annual Report.

I.

Industry structure and developments

Fiscal 2025 saw uncertainties related to interest rates, geopolitical
conditions and elections across major economies compounding
the ongoing transformation within the Tech services industry.
The year has been another year of major uncertainties in the
economy, some geopolitical flux, and novel concerns around
protectionism led disruption of global balances. The high
inflation and interest rates are driving down discretionary
spending. The year has been a year of subdued growth, pockets
of economic green shoots that have kept technology-led growth
active. AI, has unified perspectives of the industry as well as
government across geographies and sectors alike.
Global GDP is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 2024(1),
down 10bps compared to the previous year. The IT services
growth during the same period has remained flat at 4.7%(2). We
expect client spending and investments to continue to move
towards AI in the near term. These investments are expected to
be crucial during this period of economic uncertainty.
The dynamism in technologies continues and the industry is
feeling the pressure to build AI strategies and stay ahead. We saw
AI starting to reshape the industry in fiscal 2025. We continued
to witness businesses attempting to reimagine their cost
structures, increase business resilience and agility, personalize
experiences for customers and employees, and launch new and
disruptive products and services, aided by enterprise AI. With our
leadership position in AI, we believe we are well-positioned to
take advantage of these market opportunities.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

the challenge of having to reinvent their processes and systems
rapidly in the AI era. This needs an understanding of new
technologies and new ways of working, and also appreciation
of AI landscapes, business processes and practices. Our strategy
is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and
execute on their journey to an AI future by building strong data
foundations with robust cloud capabilities. We are progressing
well on our journey to leverage AI to deliver business value with
safeguards around privacy, ethics, and controls.

Our strengths
We believe that we are well-positioned for the principal
competitive factors in our business. With more than four decades
of experience in managing the systems and workings of global
enterprises, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help
them steer through their AI transformation as we have built our
own AI-first strategy and continue to invest in strengthening
our AI capabilities.

Our competition
We see intense competition in traditional services, a rapidly
changing marketplace and the emergence of new players in
niche technology areas. We have invested in building proprietary
intellectual property in software platforms and products. We
have continued to invest in Infosys Cobalt – a set of services,
solutions and platforms for enterprises to accelerate their cloud
journey, Infosys Topaz – a set of AI-first services, solutions and
platforms using generative AI technology and Infosys Aster – an
AI-amplified Marketing Suite.

During fiscal 2025, the Company continued running Project Maximus, a comprehensive margin expansion program structured across
five pillars – Value-Based Selling; Efficient Pyramid; Lean and Automation; Improving Critical Portfolios, and Reducing Indirect Costs.
Value-Based Selling is a focused strategy to identify opportunities to align pricing to the value that clients received for the services. Lean
and Automation is a strategic initiative to combine productivity and process improvement using automation technologies including
generative AI to enhance efficiency.

The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase
in realization on account of Value-Based Selling, productivity
benefit from Lean and Automation, currency, acquisition and
revenue mix partially offset by decline in volume.
Revenue growth in reported terms includes the impact of
currency fluctuations. We, therefore, additionally report the
revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents
the real growth in revenue, excluding the impact of currency
fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by
comparing current-period revenues in respective local currencies
converted to USD using prior-period exchange rates and
comparing the same to our prior-period reported revenues. Our
revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2025 is ₹1,62,990
crore, a growth of 6.1%. Our revenues for fiscal 2025 in constant
currency grew by 4.2%.
We added 365 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2025 as
compared to 385 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2024.
On a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2025,
approximately 96.9% were export revenues whereas 3.1% were
domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2024,
97.5% were export revenues whereas 2.5% were domestic
revenues. Refer to the ‘Segmental profitability’ section in this
report for more details on the analysis of segment revenues.

2. Expenditure
Cost of sales
The cost of sales have decreased as a percentage of revenue by
0.2% on standalone basis and by 0.4% on consolidated basis
in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. The cost of efforts, comprising
employee cost and cost of technical sub-contractors, has
decreased as a percentage of revenue from 60.2% in fiscal 2024
to 58.8% in fiscal 2025 on a standalone basis, and from 56.4% in
fiscal 2024 to 55.4% in fiscal 2025 on a consolidated basis.
The cost of efforts as a percentage of revenue has decreased
mainly on account of improved onsite mix, utilization and
increase in third-party costs.
Third-party items bought for service delivery to clients include
software and hardware, which are integral to our overall service
delivery to clients.
Selling and marketing expenses
The selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue
on standalone basis and consolidated basis have increased by
0.2% in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024.

101

Management’s discussion and analysis
General and administration expenses
The general and administration expenses as a percentage of
revenue on standalone and consolidated basis have decreased
by 0.3% and 0.2% respectively in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024.
Contribution towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on
standalone basis is ₹540 crore and ₹492 crore for fiscal 2025 and
2024, respectively. On consolidated basis is ₹585 crore and ₹533
crore for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.

3. Other income and finance cost
Other income primarily includes income from investments, gain
/ loss on investments, foreign exchange gain / loss on forward
and options contracts, foreign exchange gain / loss on translation
of other assets and liabilities and interest on income tax refund.
Other income for fiscal 2025 includes interest (pre-tax) on income
tax refund of ₹327 crore on account of orders received under
Sections 250 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax
authorities in India for certain assessment years. Other income
for fiscal 2024 includes interest (pre-tax) on income tax refund
of ₹1,933 crore on account of orders received under Sections
250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax
authorities in India for certain assessment years. In fiscal 2025, the
Company received ₹1,522 crore of dividend from our subsidiaries,
which is reflected in the Standalone financial statement.

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 was lower primarily on
account of reversal of tax provision due to receipt of order
giving effects in fiscal 2024 for prior assessment years. Effective
tax rate is generally influenced by various factors including
non-deductible expenses, exempt non-operating income,
overseas taxes, tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior
periods, changes to tax regulations and other tax deductions.
Tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior periods are
primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters,
upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across
various jurisdictions.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received
orders under Section 250 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the
Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17
and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position
with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a
result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and
provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed
with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to
₹1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

Interest income in fiscal 2025 has increased as compared to fiscal
2024 primarily due to increase in investible base and increase
in yield on investments. We use foreign exchange forward and
options contracts to hedge our exposure against movements in
foreign exchange rates. Finance cost is on account of leases. The
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in
the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental
borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961,
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment
of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income
(pretax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognised and provision for income
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding
credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution
of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been
reduced from contingent liabilities.

4. Provision for tax

5. Segmental profitability

We have provided for our tax liability both in India and overseas.
The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 has introduced
Section 115BAA wherein a domestic company can exercise
option for a reduced rate of corporate tax without claim of
certain deductions mentioned therein including deduction for
SEZ units under Section 10AA of the Income-tax Act, 1961. For
the fiscal 2025, the income tax expense of the Company has been
recognized by applying the provision of Section 115BAA of the
Income-tax Act without claim of deduction for SEZ units under
Section 10AA of the Income-tax Act.

% growth - 2025

Our growth has been financed largely through cash
generated from operations.
Our cash flows are robust. Our operating cash flows have
increased in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 mainly on
account of increase in net profit adjusted for non-cash items,
better working capital management partially and by lower net
income tax payments due to higher tax refunds.
Consolidated cash and investments of ₹47,549 crore
comprise cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent investments excluding investments in equity and
preference shares and others.
Capital Allocation Policy

Total growth 6.1%
Overall segment profitability has increased primarily on account
of an increase in foreign currency translation benefits, benefit
from Project Maximus arising from Value-Based Selling, and
Lean and Automation, improved utilization, and an insurance
claim receivable relating to a cyber event pertaining to fiscal
2024, partially offset by higher employee compensation, higher
cost of third-party items bought for service delivery to clients
and acquisition impact.

6. Liquidity
Our principal source of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents
and cash flow that we generate from operations. We have no
outstanding borrowings. We believe our working capital is
sufficient for our requirements.

V. Outlook, risks and concerns
We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is
implemented across the organization by the risk management
office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the
best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to
suit our unique business requirements.
We have provided the details of Infosys ERM framework, key and
emerging risks along with mitigation in the Risk management
report of this Integrated Annual Report. The list of risk factors
which we track for our business are covered in our 20-F filing
available at https://www.infosys.com/investors/reports-filings/
annual-report/annual-reports.html.

VI. Internal financial control systems and their
adequacy
Infosys has aligned its current systems of internal financial
control with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, based on
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to
increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s
process of designing and implementing a system of internal
control. The framework requires a company to identify and
analyze risks and manage appropriate responses.
Internal financial control systems include the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial
controls that are operating effectively for ensuring the orderly
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the
Company’s policies, safeguarding of its assets, prevention and
detection of frauds and errors, accuracy and completeness of
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable
financial information, as required under the Act.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and
procedures, the Management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can only provide reasonable assurance that the objectives
of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on
their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this
Integrated Annual Report, our CEO and CFO have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
provide reasonable assurance that the information required
to be disclosed in filings and submissions, is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified, and that material information related to us and our
consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions about
required disclosure.

VII. Material developments in human resources /
industrial relations, including number of people
employed
Our culture and reputation as a leader in consulting, technology,
outsourcing and next-generation digital services enable us to
attract and retain some of the best talent.
Human resources management
Infosys is a people company that understands the immense
potential of technology and strives to create a world-class
employee experience. The Company has implemented various
initiatives to inspire and enable its employees to find purpose
and make an indelible impact through meaningful work and
passionate teams, ensure that they continuously learn and
grow in their careers and shape the collective future, and create
opportunities for every employee to navigate further, powered
by the culture and values of Infosys.
This is true at each stage of career for our employees. A strong
focus on leadership development has ensured that we have a
robust leadership bench at all times, encouraging leaders from
within the Company to move up and take on new challenges.
Adapting to the changing work environment, Infosys has
adopted a hybrid model of work that balances employee
flexibility and business requirement. Leveraging technology and
automation, it has improved workforce efficiency, engagement,
transformation, and innovation. Recognizing and rewarding its
employees for their performance, excellence, and leadership,
it has fostered a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion,
and ensured a safe and positive work environment for all
its employees. Infosys has also received several awards and
accolades for its best-in-class HR practices and processes.
Resolution hubs
Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive work
environment. In keeping with this philosophy, the organization
envisages an open-door policy and encourages a culture of
“speak up”. Employees also have access to several forums
where they can highlight matters or concerns faced at the
workplace for effective remediation. This is achieved through
a well-established and robust grievance resolution mechanism

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

comprising resolution hubs. Resolution hubs adhere to the
principles of natural justice, confidentiality, sensitivity, nonretaliation and fairness, while addressing concerns. The concerns
are handled objectively while ensuring timely action and closure.
In matters that entail a detailed investigation, the process
ensures fairness for all involved, with an opportunity to be heard,
present facts and any material evidence before a neutral panel.
HEAR
Infosys has a robust grievance redressal forum called HEAR
(Hearing Employees And Resolving) fostering healthy employee
relations and a positive work environment by giving our
employees a neutral platform ‘to be heard’ and building the
culture of ‘speak up’. Employees can raise a complaint on the
HEAR webapp or InfyMe mobile application or write to HEAR@
infosys.com. HEAR adopts a decentralized model and addresses
employee concerns in a structured manner with appellate forums
for workplace grievances that have not been duly heard at the
preliminary level by the Managers (or) line HR.
ASHI
The Company’s assurance to its employees of providing a
harassment-free workplace is reflected in our key initiative, ASHI
(Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative). As per the Prevention of
Sexual Harassment Act in India, the Company has constituted
Internal Committees (IC) in all the development centers with
the ambit of the regulatory jurisdiction, for redressal of sexual
harassment matters reported by women employees. We also
have a strong governance mechanism in the form of GRB
(Grievance Redressal Body) to define, interpret and implement
the Company’s policy on prevention of sexual harassment at
the workplace. GRB consists of external members, internal
senior members, and the Investigative Council. Here, we follow
a gender-neutral approach in redressal of all such complaints.
Complaints are taken up for a formal redressal process in line
with the POSH Act and the Company’s policy on anti-harassment
as applicable. The reports on ASHI grievances can be shared to
GRB@infosys.com and employees can also report complaints on
the ASHI webapp or InfyMe mobile application.
Extending the initiative to contract staff
Our commitment to a positive and safe working environment
is not restricted only to our employees, but also third parties,
who provide services in our campuses. We conduct refresher
sessions for such third-party employees to reinforce the message.
These sessions are covered in nine vernacular languages in India
currently. Emergency / safety cards with important contact
numbers are also handed over to all Infosys employees and
employees of such third parties.
Whistleblower Policy
The Company has formulated the Whistleblower Policy in
line with the mandated regulatory requirements – SarbanesOxley Act (SOX), 2002 & Companies Act, 2013 – which
mandates listed companies to establish a “vigil mechanism” for
reporting genuine concerns.
The forum is predominantly for the receipt, retention and
treatment of complaints regarding matters of probable
discrepancies in accounting, internal accounting controls or
105

Management’s discussion and analysis
auditing, and also enables anonymous reporting by employees.
While the Whistleblower Policy and the forum is administered
and managed by the Office of Integrity and Compliance,
complaints (anonymous or otherwise) pertaining to deviations in
workplace policies / processes involving employees are reviewed
in tandem by the Employee Relations Department.
Human rights
Infosys is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact
(UNGC) and supports the protection and elevation of human
rights. Our stand on human rights is contained in an important
pillar of our Code of Conduct, viz., ‘Respecting each other.’ Refer
to Infosys Code of Conduct: https://www.infosys.com/investors/
corporate-governance/documents/codeofconduct.pdf.
Recruitment
As of March 31, 2025, the Group employed 3,23,578 employees,
of which 3,06,599 were professionals involved in service delivery
to clients, including trainees.
We continually seek and employ a diverse workforce across
various IT fields. We have established strong connections
with leading institutions worldwide and recruit students
who consistently demonstrate exceptional performance. Our
initiative, HackWithInfy, an online coding competition, has
gained international recognition once more, allowing us to draw
in top coding talent.
We remained steadfast in our commitment to the RestartWithInfy
initiative to welcome back women who were forced to take a
break from the IT industry into our workforce. We were able to
hire 935 women into the Infosys ecosystem in fiscal 2025 through
this successful endeavor.
During fiscal 2025, we received 44,57,748 employment
applications, interviewed 430,080 applicants and extended offers
of employment to 83,207 applicants. These statistics do not
include our subsidiaries.
Education, training and assessment (ETA)
Infosys continues to invest in developing human potential
for the organization, and the world at large. We are now
experiencing the play of Human + AI in multiple fields, including
learning. This technology wave gives us the ability to hyperpersonalize learning, at scale, across all our learning offerings.
These efforts have helped us garner external accolades from
Brandon Hall and ATD Best.
The Foundation Training Program, anchored across India and
multiple other countries enables newly onboarded entry-level
hires to transform into corporate professionals. Comprising over
45+ technology streams, the curriculum has kept pace with the
dynamic business requirements and the preferred pedagogical
approach of the current generation of talent. Generative AI and
prompt engineering courses have been introduced to ensure
freshers are adept in the new skills.
Our Continuous Education Program is aimed at reskilling /
upskilling our existing employees with the twin objectives of
increasing fulfilment of skilled talents in client projects and
enriching their expertise in next-generation digital technologies
and methodologies, including gen AI technologies. We provide

106

online self-learning, instructor-led virtual training opportunities
along with in-person classroom training opportunities to our
employees. Bridge programs help employees with training and
internship opportunities to switch to a new career field, while
retaining them within the organization.

curated courses, which includes over 30,000 courses procured
from vendor partners both for enterprise consumption and
niche communities with specific knowledge requirements.

More than 20,000 courses are available and about 9.2 million
learners across the world are actively consuming content on
Infosys Springboard.

VIII. Other details
1. Quality
The Quality function at Infosys, in line with the organization’s
vision and strategy of ‘Navigate the Next’, has three
strategic imperatives:
•
•
•

Differentiate Infosys’ services through superior performance
and quality
Optimize Infosys’ client projects as well as internal functions
for greater efficiency and agility
De-risk Infosys’ operations by ensuring delivery excellence,
compliance and sustainability

With usage of AI becoming mainstream, it is imperative to
standardize and scale responsible adoption of AI. To address
this need, our Quality team is working on defining an adaptable
AI-first software engineering framework, which re-imagines
the end-to-end engineering lifecycle for the services that we
provide for our clients. Starting with the requisite AI foundation,
the framework aims to lay out AI-infused process workflows with
integrated engineering, impact on team topologies and roles
and value-based governance. In addition, the evolved Infosys
digital operating model for an AI-first enterprise with productbased working, user experience design, data ecosystems,
advanced engineering, and digital talent enablement provides
the necessary foundation to help clients maximize value from
investments in digital and AI technologies.
Our Quality team continues to scale and evolve our capabilities
in new ways of working – Agile, DevSecOps, and Site Reliability
Engineering, and navigate the shift from project to product and
platform-led ways of working using our product-centric value
delivery approach. In addition, Quality Consulting also helps
clients to transform their ways of working and adopt engineering
excellence, within their organizations.

Corporate governance guidelines

Independent directors

Strong corporate governance is the bedrock of our sustained
performance and has helped us gain the trust and respect
of all our stakeholders. The enhancement of these corporate
governance standards, through periodic evaluation and change,
is one of the most important aspects of ensuring value creation
for our stakeholders.

We abide by the definitions of an independent director, as laid

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,
2015 (“the Listing Regulations”), as amended, along with the

listed company manual, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and US

Our corporate governance follows the guidelines established
by the Board of the Company. These guidelines provide a
structure within which directors and the Management can
effectively pursue the Company’s objectives for the benefit
of its stakeholders. These are framed in conjunction with the
Company’s Memorandum & Articles of Association, the charters
of the committees of the Board and applicable laws / regulations
/ guidelines in force in India, the US and other jurisdictions, as

and enhance shareholder value. As trustees, the Board has a
fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the Company has clear
goals aligned to shareholder value and its growth. Further, the
Board is also responsible for:
•

Exercising appropriate control to ensure that the Company
is managed efficiently to fulfil stakeholders’ aspirations and
societal expectations.

•

Monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s governance
practices and making changes as necessary.

the Board to tasks where there is a potential for conflict of
interest in the exercise of independent judgment.

•

Reviewing and guiding corporate strategy, major plans
of action, risk policy, annual budgets and business plans,
setting performance objectives, monitoring implementation
and corporate performance, and overseeing major capital
expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Based on the disclosures received from all independent directors
and in the opinion of the Board, the independent directors fulfil
the conditions specified in the Act, the Listing Regulations, NYSE
listing manual and are independent of the Management.

Board composition
The Company recognizes and embraces the importance of a
diverse Board in its success. We believe that a truly diverse Board
will leverage differences in thought, perspective, regional and
industry experience, cultural and geographical background,
age, ethnicity, race, gender, knowledge, skills including
expertise in financial, global business, leadership, technology,
mergers and acquisition, Board service, strategy, sales and
marketing, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), risk and
cybersecurity and other domains, which will ensure that Infosys
retains its competitive advantage.

Board meetings

Meeting of independent directors

Scheduling and selection of agenda items for Board
meetings

For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters
related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board,
it is important for the independent directors to have meetings
without the presence of the executive management.

The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal
are decided in advance and published in the Integrated
Annual Report. The Chairman and the Company Secretary,
in consultation with the CEO & MD, and lead independent
director propose the agenda for each meeting. The agenda,
along with explanatory notes is circulated to the directors in
advance to facilitate informed deliberation and decision making.
Every Board member can suggest the inclusion of additional
items in the agenda.
The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly
results and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings
are held when necessary. Independent directors are expected
to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the
Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, with the Board
being represented by independent directors from various
parts of the world, it may not be possible for all of them to be
physically present at all meetings. Hence, we provide video /
teleconferencing facilities to enable their participation.

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder
mandate that the independent directors of the Company
shall hold at least one meeting in a financial year, without the
attendance of non-independent directors and members of
the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came
into effect, our Board’s process mandated periodic meetings
attended exclusively by the independent directors.
During the year, the independent directors met four times
without the presence of executive directors and management.
At such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among
other matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced
by it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy,
leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance,
Board movements, succession planning, human resources
matters and the performance of the executive members of the
Board, committees and the Chairman.

The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare, attend
and participate in the Board and applicable committee meetings.
Each member is expected to ensure their other commitments
do not materially interfere with their responsibilities
towards the Company.

Responsible leadership
Leading by example is a key tenet of corporate governance at Infosys.
Both the Board and the Management work together to set the highest
standards of responsible leadership.
Responsibilities of the Board leadership

CEO & MD

We believe that an active, well-informed, diversified and
independent board is necessary to ensure the highest standards
of corporate governance. At Infosys, the Board is at the core
of our corporate governance practice. The Board oversees the
Management’s functions and protects the long-term interests
of our stakeholders.

The CEO & MD is responsible for executing corporate strategy
in consultation with the Board, as well as for brand equity,
planning, building external contacts and all matters related
to the management of the Company. He is responsible for
achieving annual and long-term business targets. The CEO
& MD also monitors the external and internal competitive
landscape, and new industry developments and standards,
identifies opportunities for expansion and acquisition, and
builds relationships with customers and markets to enhance
shareholder value and implement the organization’s vision,
mission, and overall direction.

The responsibilities and authority of the Chairman, the CEO & MD
and the lead independent director are as follows:

Chairman
The Company has separated the roles of Chairman and the CEO
& MD to create a more balanced governance structure. The
Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for fostering and
promoting the integrity of the Board while nurturing a culture in
which the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit
of the Company and all its stakeholders. He presides over all
meetings of the Board and of the shareholders of the Company.
The Chairman takes a lead role in managing the Board and
facilitates effective communication among directors. He is
responsible for overseeing matters pertaining to governance,
including the organization, composition and effectiveness
of the Board and its committees, and the performance of
individual directors.
The Chairman actively works with the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee to plan the composition of the
Board and Board committees, induct directors to the Board,
plan for director succession, participate effectively in the Board
evaluation process and meet with individual directors to provide
constructive feedback and advice.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

The CEO & MD acts as a link between the Board and the
Management and is also responsible for leading and evaluating
the work of other executive leaders.

Lead Independent Director
The lead independent director was appointed by the Board
to ensure robust independent leadership of the Board. The
general authority and responsibilities of the lead independent
director are decided by the group of independent directors. The
lead independent director also performs additional duties as
determined by the Board.
The lead independent director provides leadership to the
independent directors, liaises on behalf of the independent
directors and ensures the Board’s effectiveness in maintaining
high-quality governance of the organization and effective
functioning of the Board.

Fairness and excellence
Two of the core values of our C-LIFE, fairness and excellence are evident
in the workings of the Board, its evaluation and the compensation paid to
the directors and the executive leadership.
Board member evaluation

Board and executive leadership compensation

One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review
the Board evaluation framework. The Board works with the
Nomination and Remuneration Committee to lay down the
evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the
Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive /
independent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the
director being evaluated.

Executive leadership compensation

Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control
and guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the
independent directors are evaluated, include:
•

The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate
governance practices

•

The ability to contribute by introducing international best
practices to address business challenges and risks

•

Active participation in long-term strategic planning

•

Commitment to the fulfilment of a director’s obligations and
fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board
and committee meetings.

To improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees,
as well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous
Board review is undertaken on an annual basis.
The Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory
firm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for fiscal
2025. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, softer
aspects, committee effectiveness and information flow to the
Board or its committees, among other matters. The methodology
included various techniques such as questionnaires, one-onone discussions, etc. The aspects of succession planning and
committee composition were also considered. The Board
evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2025. During
the year, the recommendations of the previous year’s Board
evaluation were discussed with the Board and individual
feedback was provided. Progress on recommendations from last
year and the current year’s recommendations were discussed.
Further, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation
received from the independent directors that they met the
independence criteria as required under the Companies Act 2013,
the Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Our executive compensation programs encourage reward
for performance. A significant portion of the executives’
total rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate
performance goals to align with the interests of the shareholders.
As required under the Listing Regulations, the Nomination
and Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the
payment of remuneration to the directors, KMP, and senior
management. The Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the
Company is available on our website, at
https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/
documents/nomination-remuneration-policy.pdf.
Non-executive and non-independent chairman’s
compensation
Nandan M. Nilekani, Chairman, voluntarily chose not to receive
any remuneration for his services rendered to the Company.
Independent directors’ compensation
The compensation payable to the independent directors is
limited to a fixed amount per year as determined and approved
by the Board, the sum of which does not exceed 1% of net profit
for the year, calculated as per the provisions of the Companies
Act, 2013. The Board reviews the performance of independent
directors on an annual basis.
The Board, while deciding the basis for determining the
compensation of the independent directors, takes various things
into consideration. These include global board compensation
benchmarking, participation of individual directors in Board and
committee meetings, other responsibilities, such as membership
or chairmanship of committees, time spent in carrying out other
duties, roles and functions as prescribed in Schedule IV of the
Companies Act, 2013, Listing Regulations and such other factors
as the Board deems fit.
Shareholders at the 34th AGM held on June 22, 2015 approved
a sum not exceeding 1% of the net profit of the Company per
annum, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section
198 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be paid and distributed
among some or all of the non-executive directors of the
Company in a manner decided by the Board. This payment will
be made with respect to the profits of the Company for each year.
133

Corporate governance report
The amount payable to the independent directors for the year
ended March 31, 2025 is `17.68 crore. Additionally, independent
directors are also reimbursed for expenses incurred in the
performance of their official duties. We confirm that none of the

non-executive directors received remuneration amounting to
50% of the total remuneration paid to non-executive directors
during the year ended March 31, 2025.

The aggregate amount of remuneration (commission) was arrived at using the following criteria:

(1)

The Company normally has five regular Board meetings in a year. Independent directors are expected to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and
the AGM.

(2)

For directors based overseas, the travel fee shown is per Board meeting. This is based on the fact that additional travel time of two days will have to be
accommodated for independent directors to attend Board meetings in India.

(3)

For directors based overseas, incidental fees shown is per Board meeting. This fee is paid to independent directors for expenses incurred during their travel to
attend Board meetings in India.

The Board believes that the above compensation structure is commensurate with global best practices in terms of remunerating nonexecutive / independent directors of a company of similar size, and adequately compensates for the time and contribution made by our
non-executive / independent directors.

Indemnification agreements

Materially significant related party transactions

We have also entered into agreements to indemnify our directors
and officers for claims brought against them to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law. These agreements, among other
things, indemnify our directors and officers for certain expenses,
judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such
person in any action or proceedings, including any action by or
in the right of the Company, arising out of such persons’ services
as our director or officer, expenses in relation to public relations
consultation, if required.

Integrity and transparency & Relationship with stakeholders
Our Company upholds integrity and transparency in all transactions and
communications with stakeholders. Our stakeholders are our partners in our journey
to sustained value creation and therefore, our relationship with stakeholders and
clear communication with them is at the center of all disclosures and reports.
Corporate
Infosys was incorporated in Pune, in 1981, as Infosys Consultants
Private Limited, a private limited company under the Companies
Act, 1956. In 1983, the corporate headquarters were relocated
to Bengaluru. The name of the Company was changed to
Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys
Technologies Limited in June 1992, when the Company became a
public limited company. We made an Initial Public Offering (IPO)
in February 1993 and were listed on stock exchanges in India in
June 1993. Trading opened at ₹145 per share, compared to the
IPO price of ₹95 per share. In October 1994, we made a private
placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 each to Foreign Institutional
Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and body corporates.
On March 11, 1999, Infosys listed on NASDAQ, becoming the
first Indian company to do so. We issued 20,70,000 American
Depositary Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares
of par value ₹10 each) at US$34 per ADS under the ADS Program,
and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

The share data mentioned before is unadjusted for stock split
and bonus shares. In July 2003, June 2005 and November
2006, we issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs) of US$294 million, US$1.1 billion and US$1.6
billion, respectively.
During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed
from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark
the transition from being a technology services provider to a
business transformation partner to our clients.
During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ, and listed
them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London
and Euronext Paris. During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily
delisted from Euronext London and Paris due to low trading
volume. Infosys equity shares and ADSs are listed on NSE and BSE
in India and in NYSE, respectively, under the symbol “INFY”.

of 2:1. For example, if the investor / shareholder held one share in 1986 prior to the bonus issue and continued to hold it, he would have 16,384 shares today owing
to the bonus share issues and stock split.

Investor awareness
We have provided a synopsis of the rights and responsibilities
of shareholders on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/
investors/shareholder-services/pages/faqs.aspx.

Share transfer system
SEBI, effective April 01, 2019, barred physical transfer of shares of
listed companies and mandated transfers only through demat.
However, investors are not barred from holding shares in physical
form. We request shareholders whose shares are in physical

mode to dematerialize their shares. Shareholders holding
shares in dematerialized mode have been requested to register
their email address, bank account details and mobile number
with their depository participants. Those holding shares in
physical mode have been requested to furnish PAN, nomination,
contact details, bank account details and specimen signature
for their corresponding folios. Shareholders may contact
the RTA at, einward.ris@kfintech.com and also refer details
at https://www.infosys.com/investors/shareholder-services/
investors-service.html.

Investor conferences / events held in fiscal 2025
Infosys holds press meets and investor / analyst calls after every quarterly results announcement, which is accessible to all the
shareholders and general public. The Company also holds its Annual General Meeting, which is accessible to all the shareholders.
The details of these are sent to the stock exchanges and updated on the website. Infosys also participates in various sell-side / brokerarranged investor conferences and roadshows where the Management / Company representatives interact with investors in one-on-one
or group meetings. The details of such participation are sent to the exchanges and updated on the website.

Investor grievances and investor contacts
We have a Board-level Stakeholders Relationship Committee to
examine and redress complaints by shareholders and investors.
The status of complaints is reported to the entire Board. The
Stakeholders Relationship Committee meets as often as required
to resolve shareholder grievances.
We attended to most of the investors’ grievances and postal /
electronic communications within a period of seven days from
the date of receipt of such grievances. The exceptions have been
for cases constrained by disputes or legal impediments.

Shareholders may note that the share transfers, dividend
payments and all other investor-related activities are attended to
and processed at the office of the Company’s RTA.
For any grievances / complaints, shareholders may contact the
RTA, KFin Technologies Limited at einward.ris@kfintech.com.
For any escalations, shareholders may write to the Company at
investors@infosys.com and for queries on dividend tax, write

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Company shares-related disputes / litigation
There are certain pending civil cases involving rival claims made
by parties seeking declaration of title and accrued benefits
of the Company’s disputed shares. Since the disputed shares
relate to the Company, Infosys Limited and the Company’s RTA,
KFin Technologies Limited are made pro forma defendants
in these litigation matters. However, these matters are
not material in nature.

Commodity price risk or foreign exchange risk and
hedging activities
The Company does not deal in commodities and hence the
disclosure pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/
PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024 is not applicable.
For details of foreign exchange risk and hedging activities, refer
to Form 20-F which is available at

Statutory reports

Risk management report
“Risks related to the geo-political changes, uncertainties in the economy, supply chain constraints, evolving
regulations, technology disruption and cyber security have impacted businesses across the world during the
fiscal year. Our enterprise risk management processes were instrumental in keeping the Company focused on
our most important priorities toward all our stakeholders.”
Deepak Bhalla
EVP – Chief Risk Officer

Note: The risk-related information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive. The discussion may contain statements that are forward looking in
nature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements.
If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, operating results,
financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are
material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own
judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables
the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives by
identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring, and
governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While
this is the key driver, our values, culture, and commitment to
stakeholders – employees, customers, investors, regulatory
bodies, partners, and the community around us – are the
foundation for our ERM framework. The systematic and proactive
identification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our
organization to boost performance with effective and timely
decision-making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful
consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential
risks, and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective
resource allocation through structured qualitative and
quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based on
our risk appetite, which is defined through the ERM framework.
During the assessment, impacts and likelihood or probability
of the risks are assessed using a four-point scale, and risks are
categorized into four groups based on this. Our ERM framework

also enables the identification of underlying opportunities
during risk assessment, which are then further evaluated and
actionized by the business. Our ERM framework encompasses
all of the Company’s risks – strategy and strategy execution;
operational; legal and compliance risks. Any of these categories
can have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk
indicators are used to identify these risks proactively. We take
cognizance of risks emanating internally or externally and their
cumulative impact while framing our risk responses.
Emerging risks: Our ERM framework has defined a process to
identify, assess, plan, and monitor risks emerging from internal
and external environment which enables the Company to build
and maintain resilience in uncertain times. The process includes
horizon scanning and SWOT analysis, which cover political,
economic, social, technology, legal and environmental aspects.
The emerging risks are monitored constantly and discussed
in the risk councils and with the Risk Management Committee
(RMC) of the Board on a periodic basis.

Strategy and strategy execution

The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the
successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our
industry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target
markets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.

Operational

The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery
or operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. For
example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, human rights, fraud risks, business activity
disruptions due to natural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and
cybersecurity attacks.

Legal and compliance

The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing
resulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments,
codes of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category.

Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework
We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our
ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique
business requirements.

Risk management at Infosys encompasses all areas, including
first, second, and third lines of defence. Risk management
is embedded into the core business process and day-to-day
decision making of every function within the Company and
forms an integral part of the development process and project
execution. Risk management has been ingrained into the job
description of senior management, middle management, and
people who front-end the customer work. Achieving strategic
goals by proactively managing the risks is the responsibility of
the Company’s management at all levels. Financial incentives are
linked to the achievement of strategic goals. As the first line of
defence, they evaluate risks and opportunities before taking key
business decisions. This first line works closely with corporate
ERM through risk councils and sub-risk councils created across
the organization in different units.
The second line of defence consists of various risk functions such
as Information Security Group (ISG), Data Privacy Office (DPO),
Quality, Delivery Risk Management (DRM), Business Continuity,
Legal, Compliance, etc., who work very closely with ERM function
in identifying, assessing, reporting and governing the risks. While
risks are largely mitigated by the first line / business, they are
tracked and governed by the second line. These are reported
to the executive leadership through various councils, including
the Operational Risk Council (ORC) and the Legal & Compliance
Risk Council (LCRC). These key risks are also presented to the Risk
Management Committee (RMC) of the Board on a quarterly basis.

150

The third line of defence encompasses an internal audit that
reviews various risks and controls on a periodic basis to assess
the effectiveness of the risk management process and report
independently. Inputs on key risks by the ERM are considered
while drafting the audit plan. The Company maintains a single
hierarchical risks repository from L1 to L5, covering strategic
to tactical risks. All these are governed by the integrated ERM
framework of the Company. This is how all lines of defence are
aligned as depicted in the ERM framework above.
The Company also conducts maturity assessment of the ERM
process on a periodic basis by an independent external agency.
The recent maturity assessment was conducted in March 2024.
Risk management is ingrained in all parts of the organization.
Risk-enabled decision-making and forums at various levels of
the organization to enhance risk-related decisions to identify
and mitigate the risks are the hallmarks of a good risk culture. At
Infosys, this is enabled through the implementation of integrated
Enterprise Risk Management, and this function acts as a decision
support system for the executive leadership. A multi-layered
governance structure provides open forums for risk discussions
at various levels. Comprehensive awareness and training
programs are conducted on a regular basis for all the employees
and contractors to cover risks applicable to the business. Lex,
our in-house learning platform, offers various risk management
courses which are accessible from anywhere in the world.
Periodic table-top exercises are conducted in key areas to review
preparedness for high impact-low probability risks.

Salient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program
Our ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness across the organization.

Secondary, consequential and residual risks

Intelligent risk analytics

Secondary risks are threats that could impede the mitigation
of primary risks. Consequential risks are the unintended
consequences of primary mitigation, and residual risks are
those risks that are left over after mitigation.

Aggregation and accumulation
Exposure for same risks are aggregated as it goes up the
hierarchy. This provides enterprise-wide view
to the leadership. Cumulated risk view is also provided to
understand total exposure arising out of all risks at a unit level.

Internal and external risk and performance indicators,
and loss incidents are used in real time to identify,
analyze and assess potential issues that could negatively
impact strategic goals.

Process risk frameworks

RISC360 : iGRC
RISC360 is the Company’s Governance, Risk management and
Compliance (GRC) program that combines three lines of defense
under one umbrella. This enables risk-based decision-making and
auditing. The Company has implemented a technology platform,
iGRC, to provide a consolidated view of risks to strategic goals.

Risk culture

Process-specific risk frameworks have been
developed for decision-making,
for example, frameworks for customer risk,
vendor risk, contractual liability, contractual
weighted risk and credit risk.

Our risk culture encourages open and upward communication.
Coupled with our belief systems and core values, this drives
behavior, guides daily activities and decision-making throughout
the organization. We encourage sharing of knowledge and best
practices, continuous process improvement and a strong
commitment to ethics and integrity.

Highlights of fiscal 2025
During fiscal 2025, various risks management initiatives were
undertaken so as to ensure the smooth delivery of services to
our clients, transparent communication with all stakeholders,
fulfilment of our social responsibility while ensuring employee
safety and health by strengthening risk management program
and enhancing the risk culture. The risk office assessed,
monitored and reported on risks related to geo-political

scenarios; uncertainties in the economy; inflation; technology
disruption and innovation; talent availability; cybersecurity; data
protection and privacy; ESG; contractual liabilities; and complex
and evolving regulatory environment.
While the Company tracks several risks to its business, the key
risks and emerging risks are described below along with the
Company’s approach to mitigate them.

Geo-political,

•

•

Our revenues are concentrated in a few geographies
and client industries, and a large part of our revenue is
dependent on a limited number of clients. Unfavorable
geo-political, economic, or health events may result in
currency volatility and reduced spend on technology
products and services which may adversely impact
demand for our offerings which in turn may impact
our growth and profitability.
Emerging risk aspect: Geo-political, economic or
health events are dynamic in nature and constantly
evolving. Uncertainty and unpredictability of policy
changes by governments such as tariffs, trade
restrictions etc., sometimes make it difficult to predict
and assess the impact.

Emerging risk: Not having the right framework
and approach to identify, invest in, incubate and
operationalize new services and offerings that are in
line with technology changes like AI, client preferences
and market expectations may disrupt our value
proposition and reduce our relevance to customers,
impacting our revenue and profitability. The speed

Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
5. Inherent limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows
for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between companies.
6. Our Independence and Quality Control
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Master Circular and its clarifications thereto and have the required
competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
We apply Standard on Quality Control (“SQC”) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial
Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

7. Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I based
on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “Assurance
Engagements on Sustainability Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements (SAE) 3410 “Assurance Engagements on
Greenhouse Gas Statements” (together the “Standards”), both issued by the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of
the ICAI.
These standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Identified
Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the Report are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the
Criteria.
As part of a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with the Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
8. Reasonable Assurance
A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified
Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed,
inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
• Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
• Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements of the Identified
Sustainability Information;
• Made inquiries of Company’s management, including environment team, compliance team, human resource team amongst others
and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report;
• Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls for recording,
processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate office and at other locations/offices on
a sample basis. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the engagement and determining whether
they have been implemented by performing procedures in addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the Identified
Sustainability Information;
• Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated,
determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures;
• Tested the key assumptions, emission factors and methodologies used for calculation of the Greenhouse Gas (the “GHG”) emissions;
• Tested the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the identified
sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis; and
• Tested the consolidation for locations/offices on a sample basis and corporate office under the reporting boundary for ensuring the
completeness of data being reported.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.
9. Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on:
• Aspects of the Report and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability Information;
and
• The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by the
Company.
10. Other information
The Company’s management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
within the BRSR, the IAR and the Environment Social and Governance (the “ESG”) Report, other than Identified Sustainability
Information and our independent assurance reports dated May 31, 2025, thereon.

156

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Our opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance thereon.
In connection with our assurance engagement of the Identified Sustainability Information, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Identified Sustainability
Information or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
11. Reasonable Assurance Opinion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core indicators for the year ended March
31, 2025, listed in Appendix I are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria as stated in paragraph 3 above.
12. Restriction on use
Our Reasonable Assurance report has been prepared and addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company at the request of the
Company solely, to assist the Company in reporting on Company’s sustainability performance and activities. Accordingly, we accept
no liability to anyone, other than the Company. Our Reasonable Assurance report should not be used for any other purpose or by any
person other than the addressees of our report. We neither accept nor assume any duty of care or liability for any other purpose or to
any other party to whom our report is shown or into whose hands it may come without our prior consent in writing.

10. Health and safety management system:
10a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes / No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes. Infosys recognizes and accords highest priority to safety and well-being of its employees and other relevant parties. Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and
commitment towards the management of key Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) aspects. In line with our strategy, our Health, Safety and Environmental Management System
(HSEMS) at all India locations is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard. HSEMS is implemented at all our overseas locations based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and
have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions to address occupational health-related topics such as emotional well-being,
mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health centers are available at all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and
physiotherapists have helped employees and their families through virtual consultations leveraging our telemedicine portal. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are
available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.

10b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

We proactively identify occupational health and safety risks, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes, including routine
and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination
and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no
product risks, but there are risks associated with the provision of services such as ergonomics at work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employees’ commute.
Participation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments. Risks are also assessed before and after the development
of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and ongoing operations is also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being built.
More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupationalhealth-safety.html.

10c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y / N)

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
Infosys acknowledges that Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) is one of the key aspects of sustainable business practices. OH&S policies, processes, and practices at
Infosys promote the physical, emotional, and social well-being of employees in the workplace. The robust Health and Safety Management system at Infosys has earned us
the certification of ISO 45001:2018 for all Indian locations, including Infosys Limited and its subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy.
The Company has implemented the following measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace:
1. Incident management: Incidents, which include near misses / potential hazards / accidents, are reported through internal applications or email. The causes of incidents
are identified, analyzed and appropriate corrective actions are taken to prevent recurrence or occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / losses.
2. OH&S Committee: Both employees and contract workers are part of the Infosys OH&S Committee, which helps in ensuring their active participation and consultation.
3. Training and awareness: Training includes awareness building, mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS training is a part of our employee
induction program. To enable continuous learning, an HSE awareness module is available on Lex, our internal learning platform. For contract staff, job-specific and
general training is provided during induction and later through refresher training.
4. Safety interventions: We have always focused on building a culture of safety at Infosys. The safety systems in place include work permits, trainings, Lock Out Tag
Out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits, operational controls, and monitoring. Policies have been established focusing on specific areas such as women’s safety, lone
working, transport, travel, construction and others.
5. Medical services: We have set up first aid centers on our campuses in India. Some of the first aid facilities are operational round the clock. Our telemedicine portal
continues to operate and allows our employees to consult the doctors at our occupational health centers in India online. We have ambulance services available or have
arrangements for ambulances to be made available at all our India-based locations.
6. Health Risk Assessment (HRA): HRA is conducted annually based on inputs from the OHC. Being an IT / ITES company, the prevalent risks include ergonomics,
Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), emotional well-being, etc., associated with the workplace, operation of utilities, and commute. Numerous initiatives, interventions,
engagement virtual sessions, and process controls are in place to address these risks.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Infosys has been carbon neutral since fiscal 2020 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our approach to carbon neutrality is based on reducing and avoiding emissions through energy
efficiency and renewable energy. Energy efficiency is achieved through super-efficient new buildings, industry-leading Energy Performance Index (EPI) <65 kWh/m2-yr, real-time
monitoring and optimization of building operations through smart building systems, and retrofits in existing buildings. Infosys has implemented several retrofit projects (across air
conditioning, lighting, and UPS systems) in the past and achieved a connected electrical load reduction of 36 MW across campuses in India. In 2025, we have undertaken a retrofit
project to replace direct FCU units with chilled water units of air conditioning, which saved 1.3 lakh kWh and reduced emissions by 94.72 tCO2e. To achieve our goal of transitioning
to clean energy, we have installed 60 MW of solar PV capacity.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and
toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The 5R principle –’ Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish / Repurpose and Recycle’ – forms the foundation of Infosys’ waste management strategy. Through our efforts, we turn waste
into resources and thus support a circular economy. Infosys has adopted a comprehensive waste management practice which involves collection, sorting and disposal of waste.
Waste management practices at Infosys include source segregation, secondary segregation, effective waste processing and collection, recycling and efficient disposal of all waste in
accordance with relevant laws. This helps reduce negative impacts on the environment.
We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with technological investment in recycling and streamlining of systems and
processes. Infosys is pursuing the goal of zero waste to landfill at all of its own sites by 2030, utilizing the TRUE Certification for Zero Waste, provided by Green Business Certification
Inc. TRUE Certification requires a facility to divert at least 90% of its waste from landfill, incineration (waste-to-energy), and the environment. Using TRUE’s portfolio approach,
Infosys has earned TRUE Certification for three campuses last year, and is committed to achieving certification for seven of its owned campuses in fiscal 2026 and subsequently will
embark on the certification for the rest of the owned locations.
The e-waste is disposed to authorized refurbishers, recyclers who issue us certificates for successful recycling and recovery of the material. These are established with a focus on
adhering to principles of circularity. Other hazardous waste such as biomedical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other trash are designated by the Central
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). These agencies incinerate the waste in compliance with the rules and regulations. The resulting ash is
used in some places for the manufacture of cement and is sent for Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) landfills for safe disposal.

5. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
Infosys has a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) called Phoenix, certified by ISO 22301:2019 Security and Resilience – Business Continuity Management
Standard. This program is designed to ensure seamless continuity of business and the utmost safety of our employees and assets while continuously meeting client
expectations. The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and continually
improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries. Apart from Phoenix plan at the corporate level, comprehensive business continuity plans are
created at three operational levels covering business functions, locations, and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide
our typical response to events, such as catastrophes and natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. This covers various
crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments (at functions, locations, and accounts level), which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in
place. The management system has been continuously validated across levels through tests and exercises, and various incidents have been successfully tackled without
significant business continuity or employee safety impacts. An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain status quo during disasters.

and held extensive discussions with various stakeholders,
including academicians, industry leaders, and the public. We,
at Infosys, have participated in many of these discussions and
workshops conducted by the MeitY and industry bodies. This
enabled us to gather valuable insights and provide inputs to
the authorities, which will play a crucial role in drafting the
final regulations.
Infosys hosted its first in-person Privacy Symposium at
its Bengaluru campus, which was attended by a large
number of industry experts, academicians, and civil
society representatives. Senior officials from Government
delivered the keynote address and moderated one of the

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members Of Infosys Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”), which comprise the
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes
in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of
material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view
in conformity with the indian accounting standards prescribed under section 133 of the act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles
generally accepted in india, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025 and its profit, total comprehensive income,
changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under
section 143(10) of the act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit
of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit
of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the act and the rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as

matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter

1

Revenue recognition
The Company’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The Company derives
revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings and business
process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance
obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of
the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.
In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is
recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when
the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the
specified goods or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible
for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to
determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed
through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method
when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is
not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of
method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature
of the deliverables.
As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2)
determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is
recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments
were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.
Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the
Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line
basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:
•

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b)
determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion
method.
We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:
– Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents
that were part of the agreement.
– Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i)
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii)
whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion
method.

Key Audit Matter

Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price,
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentageof-completion method.
Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended
to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to
measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total
efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes
based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the
period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of
completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the
term of the contracts.
This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.
Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the
following, among others:
•

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of
efforts incurred.
We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and
performed the following:
– Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance
obligations that have been fulfilled.
– Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs
or efforts to complete the contract.
– Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts
to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and
Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements,
Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of
these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, including other
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and
presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
•

•

•
•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company
has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness
of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by the management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

213

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced.
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the Members of
Infosys Limited of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the
“Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the
year ended on that date.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with
reference to Standalone Financial Statements based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial
information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the
Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with
reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference
to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk
that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(c)

We have taken into consideration the whistle blower complaints received by the Company during the year (and upto the
date of this report), while determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.

xii.

The Company is not a Nidhi Company and hence reporting under clause (xii) of the Order is not applicable.

Financial Statements as required by the applicable accounting standards.

xiv.

(a)

In our opinion, the Company has an adequate internal audit system commensurate with the size and the
nature of its business.

(b) We have considered, the internal audit reports for the year under audit, issued to the Company during the year and till date,
in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.
xv.

In our opinion, during the year the Company has not entered into any non-cash transactions with its Directors or persons
connected with its directors and hence provisions of section 192 of the Companies Act, 2013 are not applicable to the Company.

xvi.

(a)

In our opinion, the Company is not required to be registered under section 45-IA of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.

The Company has not incurred cash losses during the financial year covered by our audit and the immediately
preceding financial year.

On the basis of the financial ratios, ageing and expected dates of realisation of financial assets and payment of financial
liabilities, other information accompanying the financial statements and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and
Management plans and based on our examination of the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our
attention, which causes us to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report indicating that
Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a
period of one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of
the Company. We further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither give
any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date, will get
discharged by the Company as and when they fall due.

xx.

(b) In respect of ongoing projects, the Company has transferred unspent CSR amount as at the end of the previous financial
year, to a Special account within a period of 30 days from the end of the said financial year in compliance with the provision
of section 135(6) of the Companies Act, 2013.
In respect of ongoing projects, the Company has not transferred the unspent CSR amount as at the Balance Sheet date out
of the amounts that was required to be spent during the year, to a Special Account in compliance with the provision of subsection (6) of section 135 of the said Act till the date of our report since the time period for such transfer, i.e., 30 days from
the end of the financial year has not elapsed till the date of our report.

nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with
investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The
Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

Overview and Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
1. Overview
1.1 Company overview
Infosys Limited ("the Company" or Infosys) provides
consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation
digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their
digital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a
sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of
clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and
generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to
be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on
their journey to a digital future.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and
domiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics City,
Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company
has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock
Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary
Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The Standalone financial statements are approved for issue by the
Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2025.

1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements
These Standalone financial statements are prepared in accordance
with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (''the Act''),
guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (SEBI) and Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) under the
historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain
financial instruments which are measured at fair values, defined
benefit liability / (asset) which is recognized at the present value
of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. The Ind
AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3
of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and
relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where
a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a
revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in
the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting
policy information used in preparation of the audited condensed
standalone interim financial statements have been discussed in
the respective notes.
As the year to date figures are taken from the source and
rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the
previous quarters might not always add up to the year to date
figures reported in this statement.

1.3 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and
assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. The application of accounting policies
that require critical accounting estimates involving complex
and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in
these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.4.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate
changes in estimates are made as management becomes aware
of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes
in estimates and judgements are reflected in the financial
statements in the period in which changes are made and, if
material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Standalone
financial statements.

1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
The Company’s contracts with customers include promises to
transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues
from customer contracts are considered for recognition and
measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing,
by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are
committed to perform their respective obligations under the
contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company
assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies
distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of
distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables
and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from
such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these
distinct performance obligations involves significant judgement.
Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a
straight-line basis when services are performed through an
indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period.
Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized
ratably using a percentage of completion method when the
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer
and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the
period of the contract because the services are generally discrete
in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the
maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method
in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the
percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to
determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a
proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred.
Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress
towards completion as there is a direct relationship between
input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs
involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the
period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest
available information.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue

233

from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded
net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company
first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods
or services before they are transferred to the customer. The
Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services,
inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine
whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore,
is acting as a principal or an agent.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
b. Income taxes
The Company's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the
United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other
overseas jurisdictions.

2. Notes to the Standalone financial statements
2.1 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting Policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly
attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property,
plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the
Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is
derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected
useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Building(1)
Plant and machinery

22-25 years
(1)

Office equipment

5 years
5 years

Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision
for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid /
recovered for uncertain tax positions.

Computer equipment(1)

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures(1)

5 years

Vehicles(1)

5 years

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the
Management considers whether some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The
Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax
assets are deductible, management believes that the Company
will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The
amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of
future taxable income during the carry forward period are
reduced. Refer to Note 2.17

Leasehold improvements

c. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion
of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of
periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate
of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual
value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values
of Company's assets are determined by the Management
at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically,
including at each financial year end. The lives are based on
historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation
of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in
technology. Refer to Note 2.1

234

(1)

Lower of useful life of the asset
or lease term

Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the
useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the
Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for
these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of
Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are
reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The
useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets
as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their
life, such as changes in technology.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified
as capital advances under other non-current assets and the
cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed
under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures
relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item
can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon
sale or retirement of the asset.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined
on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate
cash flows that are largely independent of those from other
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for
the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by
the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the
estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss
is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable

amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its
revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined
(net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss
been recognized for the asset in prior years.

2.2.2 Other intangible assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective
individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an
identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other
economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures
required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically
including at each financial year end.
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and
commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability
to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of
material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

Accounting policy
The Company as a lessee

whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or
terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease
term, the Company considers factors such as any significant
leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs
relating to the termination of the lease and the importance
of the underlying asset to Infosys’s operations taking into
account the location of the underlying asset and the availability
of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current
economic circumstances.

The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for
land, buildings and computers. The Company assesses whether
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right
to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses
whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset
(ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits
from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably
certain that they will be exercised.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company
recognizes a Right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease
liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except
for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases)
and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases,
the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and
useful life of the underlying asset. The ROU assets are evaluated
for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For
the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e.
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is
determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not
generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from
other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

As a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the noncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend
or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably
certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected
lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses

238

The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the
lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation
and impairment losses.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the
present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if
not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates
in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right
of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it
will exercise an extension or a termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in
the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as
financing cash flows.

The Company as a lessor
Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance
or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee,
the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are
classified as operating leases.
When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for
its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The
sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference
to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.
For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease.

2.11.1 Initial recognition
The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities
when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized
at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables
which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair
value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial
recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are
accounted for at trade date.
2.11.2 Subsequent measurement
a. Non-derivative financial instruments
(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost

Others

Unbilled revenues(2)

Accounting policy

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost
if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold
the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the
contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVOCI)
A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through
other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model
whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
outstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election
for its investments which are classified as equity instruments
to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other
comprehensive income based on its business model.
(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through
profit or loss (FVTPL)
A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above
categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost
using the effective interest method, except for contingent
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

consideration recognized in a business combination which is
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
(v) Investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate
financial statements.
b. Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the
risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures.
The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.
(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value
through profit or loss.
This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities
which are not designated as hedges.
Although the Company believes that these derivatives
constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may
not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial
Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as
hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is
categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value
through profit or loss.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially
at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized
in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured
at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange
gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in
this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities
if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized
within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
(ii) Cash flow hedge
The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward
and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate
the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable
forecast cash transactions.
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of
the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized
immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument
recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the
hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve
until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or
loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the
forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the
amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified
to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments
The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire
or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for
derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of
a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance
Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged
or cancelled or expires.
2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments
In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the
Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are
based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting
date. The methods used to determine fair value include
discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market
multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All
methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of
value, and such value may never actually be realized.
Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the
disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and
liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one
year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair
value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the
short maturity of these instruments.
2.11.5 Impairment
The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected
credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled
revenues which are not fair valued through profit or loss.
Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues
with no significant financing component is measured at an
amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets,
expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to
the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase
in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are
measured at lifetime ECL.
The Company determines the allowance for credit losses
based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current
and estimated future economic conditions. The Company
considers current and anticipated future economic conditions
relating to industries the Company deals with and the
countries where it operates.
The amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss
allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required
to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in
Statement of Profit and Loss.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, tax-free bonds and non-convertible debentures of ₹1,986 crore were transferred from Level 2
to Level 1 of fair value hierarchy since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, State government securities of ₹73 crore were
transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs
A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a
significant impact in its value.
Majority of investments of the Company are fair valued based
on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily
include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity
fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial
papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible
debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasigovernment organizations. The Company invests after
considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria
including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating,
Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's
risk management program.

Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial
risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's
primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial
markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its
financial performance. The primary market risk to the Company

is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial
instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures.
The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the
individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration
of risk from the top few customers.
Market risk
The Company operates internationally and a major portion of
the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently
the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through
its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and
purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies.
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the
risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures.
The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign
currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may
fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of
the Company’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee
appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 the
Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward
and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk
of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast
cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance
in cash flow hedge reserve as at March 31, 2025 are expected
to occur and reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss
within three months.
The Company determines the existence of an economic
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item
based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted
cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception
of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective
effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic
relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging

instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is
expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer
optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged
and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the
hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the
volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged
item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk
management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated
and accounted for in the Statement of Profit or Loss at the time of
the hedge relationship rebalancing.

March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by
the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily
from trade receivables amounting to ₹26,437 crore and ₹25,152
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively and
unbilled revenue amounting to ₹11,988 crore and ₹10,814 crore
as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Trade
receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and
are derived from revenue from customers majorly located in the
United States of America and Europe. Credit risk has always been
managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing
credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness
of the customers to which the Company grants credit terms in
the normal course of business. The Company uses the expected
credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a
provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance
for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into
account credit reports and other related credit information to
the extent available.
The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the
individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration
of risk from the top few customers. Exposure to customers is
diversified and there is no single customer contributing more
than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and unbilled revenues.
The following table gives details in respect of percentage
of revenues generated from top five customers
and top ten customers:

profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group’s
risk management program.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be
able to settle or meet its obligations on time.

As at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 2,88,384 and 2,91,795 cash-settled options were outstanding respectively. The carrying value of
liability towards cash-settled share-based payments was ₹8 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 respectively.
The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and
Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected
term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of
the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the
options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of
their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated
between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.
The fair value of each equity-settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

2.16 Provisions
Accounting policy
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation
that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the liability. The Company recognizes
a reimbursement asset when, and only when, it is virtually
certain that the reimbursement will be received if the Company
settles the obligation.
a. Post-sales client support
The Company provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales
support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs
associated with such support services are accrued at the time
related revenues are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company estimates such costs based on historical experience
and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material
changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.
b. Onerous contracts
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the
expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future
obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses,
if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in
which such losses become probable based on the estimated
efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is
measured at the present value of the lower of the expected
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of
continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established,
the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets
associated with that contract.

2.17 Income taxes
Accounting policy
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax.
Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Statement
of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items
recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in
equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for
current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected
to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax
assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax
benefit will be realized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes
in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is
recognized as income or expense in the period that includes
the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred
income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable profit will be available against which the
deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed
earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that
the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in
the foreseeable future.
The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities;
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts
and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The income
tax provision for the interim period is made based on the best
estimate of the annual average tax rate expected to be applicable
for the full financial year. Tax benefits of deductions earned on
exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation
charged to income are credited to equity.
Income tax expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss comprises:

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the
year ended March 31, 2025 is 25.17% and for the year ended
March 31, 2024 is 34.94%.

The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas,
principally in the United States.
In India, the Company has benefited from certain income tax
incentives that the Government of India had provided for export
of software and services from the units registered under the
Special Economic Zones Act (SEZs), 2005 in the prior years. SEZ
units which began the provision of services on or after April
1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains
derived from the export of services for the first five years from
the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision of
services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five years.
Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further
five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone reinvestment Reserve out of the profit for the eligible SEZ units
and utilization of such reserve by the Company for acquiring new
plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the
provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (Refer to Special Economic
Zone Re-investment reserve under Note 2.12 Equity).
Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2025 and
March 31, 2024 substantially relates to origination and reversal of
temporary differences.

Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 and
March 31, 2024 includes provisions (net of reversals) of ₹97 crore
and reversals (net of provisions) of ₹913 crore, respectively.
These provisions and reversals pertaining to prior periods are
primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters,
upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across
various jurisdictions.

Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to
the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater
than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the
year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code.
As at March 31, 2025, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to
approximately ₹7,755 crore. As at March 31, 2025, the Company
has a deferred tax liability for branch profit tax of ₹271 crore (net
of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits
are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received
orders under Section 250 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, from the
Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17
and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position
with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a
result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and
provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed
with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to
₹1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on
temporary differences amounting to ₹16,593 crore and ₹10,776
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively,
associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as
the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The
Company majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries
and branches only to the extent these can be distributed
in a tax-free manner.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income Tax Act, 1961,
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment
of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pretax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognised and provision for income
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding

Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on
accumulated losses of ₹1,466 crore and ₹1,358 crore as at March
31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively as it is probable that
future taxable profit will not be available against which the
unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future.
Majority of the accumulated losses as at March 31, 2025 will expire
between financial years 2028 to 2030.

In assessing the reliazibility of deferred income tax assets, the
Management considers whether some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The
Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets
are deductible, management believes that the Company will
realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount
of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however,
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
income during the carry forward period are reduced.
The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired
in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and
currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best
estimate determined based on the expected value method.

2.18 Revenue from operations
Accounting policy
The Company derives revenues primarily from IT services
comprising software development and related services, cloud
and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms
across the Company’s core and digital offerings (together called
as “software-related services”). Contracts with customers are
either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a
fixed-timeframe basis.
Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition
and measurement when the contract has been approved in
writing, by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract
are committed to perform their respective obligations under
the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue
is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products
or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration the Company has
received or expects to receive in exchange for these products
or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as
to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such
uncertainty is resolved.
The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and
identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct
performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling
price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when
sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling
price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method
used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost
plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost
of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an
appropriate margin based on similar services.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

The Company’s contracts may include variable consideration
including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Company
includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when
there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable
consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal
of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the
uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts,
are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straightline basis when services are performed through an indefinite
number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using
a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits
from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs
to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract
because the services are generally discrete in nature and not
repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe
contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over
time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.
Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress
towards completion as there is a direct relationship between
input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured
as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work
performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates
of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously
monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in
net profit in the period when these estimates change or when
the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total
costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic
performance-based billing and / or milestone based progress
billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled
revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as
contract liabilities (which we refer to as "unearned revenues").
In arrangements for software development and related
services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue
recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation,
the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria
for considering software development and related services as
distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction
price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each
performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone
selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when
sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling
price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the
standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost
plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling
price. For software development and related services, the
performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services
are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the
work as it progresses.
Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include
multiple elements which may be subject to other specific
accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

guidance. In such arrangements where the Company is able to
determine that hardware and services are distinct performance
obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance
obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In
the absence of standalone selling price, the Company uses
the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the
standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered
as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over
the period and measure of progress is determined based on
promise in the contract.
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right
to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license
is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses
where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized
over the access period.
Arrangements to deliver software products generally have
three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical
Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in
conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and
implementation have been identified as two distinct separate
performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts
are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract
based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence
of standalone selling price for implementation, the Company
uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the
standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be
substantially customized as part of the implementation service
the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation
is considered to be a single performance obligation and the
revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion
method as the implementation is performed. Revenue from client
training, support and other services arising due to the sale of
software products is recognized as the performance obligations
are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line
basis over the period in which the services are rendered.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded
net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company
first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods
or services before they are transferred to the customer. The
Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services,
inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine
whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore,
is acting as a principal or an agent.
A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both
of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract.
A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct
performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate
contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone
selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and
creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone
selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct

269

performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing
contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs
that would not have been incurred if the contract had not
been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company
expects to recover them.
Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition
or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate
performance obligation are recognized as an asset when
such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate
or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in
satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are
expected to be recovered.
Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to
customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs
are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life
on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or
services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs
are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are
recorded when present value of projected remaining operating
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of
the capitalized costs.
The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its
Statement of Profit and Loss.

The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for
the Year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is 58%
and 56%, respectively.
Trade receivables and Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections
results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue
on the Company’s Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work
progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms,
either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon
achievement of contractual milestones.
The Company’s receivables are rights to consideration that
are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in

270

excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixedprice maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset
when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only
after a passage of time.
Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on
milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of
revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to
the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price
contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset
because the right to consideration is dependent on completion
of contractual milestones.
Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of
impairment in the Balance Sheet.
During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 , the
Company recognized revenue of ₹4,404 crore and ₹4,189 crore
arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2024 and
April 1, 2023 respectively.
During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024,
₹4,448 crore and ₹6,396 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining
to other fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts as
of April 1, 2024 and April 1, 2023, respectively has been
reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on
completion of milestones.
Remaining performance obligation disclosure
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the
aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized
as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as
to when the Company expects to recognize these amounts in
revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS
115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance
obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue
recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer
of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those
contracts where invoicing is on time-and-material and unit
of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several
factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts,
periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not
materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are
completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2025, other
than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is
₹90,815 crore. Out of this, the Company expects to recognize
revenue of around 50.9% within the next one year and around
20.4% between one and two years and remaining thereafter. The
aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely
or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024 is ₹80,334 crore.
The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers
and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty
payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated
contracts without cause.

2.19.1 Other income

Other income for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March
31, 2024 is as follows:

Accounting policy
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend
income, gain / loss on investments and exchange gain / loss
on forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign
currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using
the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized
when the right to receive payment is established.
2.19.2 Foreign currency
Accounting policy
Functional currency
The functional currency of the Company is the Indian rupee.
These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees
(rounded off to crore; one crore equals ten million).
Transactions and translations
Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities
are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange
rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses
resulting from such translations are recognized in the Statement
of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses)
on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred
in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated
in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at
the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was
determined. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical
cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of
the transaction. The related revenue and expense are recognized
using the same exchange rate.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign
currency transactions are included in determining net profit
for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue,
expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the
exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.
Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation
differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at
fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as
financial instruments and measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVOCI).
Government grant
The Company recognizes government grants only when there is
reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them shall
be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government
grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are
recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss
on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the
asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized on
a systematic basis in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and
Loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related
costs which they are intended to compensate.

These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The
plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a
lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes
death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require
contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that
varies depending on the age of the respective employees.
Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external
actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected
unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the
Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate
risk and market risk.
The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit
plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses
through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability
/ (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and
are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The
actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields
computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the
defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive
income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net
profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.21.2 Provident fund

2.21 Employee benefits

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident
fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee
and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident
fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered
employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the
Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust
invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian
law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government
administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest
is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered
by the Government of India. The Company has an obligation
to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the
investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate.

Accounting policy

2.21.3 Superannuation

2.21.1 Gratuity and pensions

Certain employees of Infosys are participants in a defined
contribution plan. The Company has no further obligations to
the Plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically
contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with
the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement
plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible Indian employees
of Infosys. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment
to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation
or termination of employment, of an amount based on the
respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment
with the Company. The Company contributes Gratuity liabilities
to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the
Trust"). Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and
contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance
Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.
The Company operates defined benefit pension plan in certain
overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws.

2.21.4 Compensated absences
The Company has a policy on compensated absences which
are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The
expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is
determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external
actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit
method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed
as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the
Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated
absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered
as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government
bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2)

The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision
trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3)

Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been
considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of postemployment benefit obligation.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions
regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance
with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation
of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions
regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to
the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and
other relevant data.

•

The Company assesses all the above assumptions
with its projected long-term plans of growth and
prevalent industry standards.

•

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards
gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund
Trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust.
The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have
been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the
asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the
investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations
applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The
insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed
interest rates arrangements.

The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of
defined benefit obligation is as follows :
(In ₹ crore)

Actual return on assets (including remeasurement) of the gratuity
plan for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 were
₹152 crore and ₹125 crore, respectively and for the pension plan
were ₹59 crore and ₹21 crore, respectively.
The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the
Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risk
which are set out below:
•

Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit
plan liability is generally calculated using a discount rate
determined by reference to government bond yields and in
certain overseas jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to
government bond yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If
bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to
increase.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund
offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash
lump sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined
rates for converting the lump sum to a pension and there is
the risk that the members live longer than implied by these
conversion rates and that the pension assets don’t achieve
the investment return implied by these conversion rates.
Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in
equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds
in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the
short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible
for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified
given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund
and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on
members’ account balances.

Sensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed
by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation
of defined benefit obligation, keeping all other actuarial
assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and
changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The Company expects to contribute ₹350 crore to gratuity and
₹27 crore to pension during the fiscal 2026.

2.22 Earnings per equity share
Accounting Policy
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net
profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the
Company by the weighted average number of equity shares
considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also
the weighted average number of equity shares that could have
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity
shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at
fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity
shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted
as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently
for each period presented.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity
shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for
any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes
effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by
the Board of Directors.

Accounting policy
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from
past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of Infosys Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries
(the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March
31, 2025, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of
Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements,
including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated
Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial
Statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair
view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025 and their consolidated
profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter

1

Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with products and services. The group derives revenues from IT
services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation,
licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business process management
services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the
contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to
benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.
In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is
recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods
or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether
it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize
the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations,
(2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue
is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these
judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.
Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the
Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis
or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:
•

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b)
determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion
method.
We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures: obligations, (2)
determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is
recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:
– Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents
that were part of the agreement.
– Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i)
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii)
whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion
method

Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the
period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price,
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentageof-completion method.
Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date
as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure
progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts
or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on
the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in
which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of
completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the
term of the contracts.
This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.
Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the
following, among others:
•

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of
efforts incurred.
We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and
performed the following:
– Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance
obligations that have been fulfilled.
– Compared efforts or costs incurred with Group’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs
or efforts to complete the contract.
– Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts
to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the Consolidated
Financial Statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during
the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and
presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated
financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group
in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The
respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have
been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are
responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intends to liquidate their
respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial
reporting process of the Group.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
•

•

•
•

296

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company
and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to
Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by the management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the
Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our

our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an
opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

•

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced.
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A” To The Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the Members of
Infosys Limited of even date)

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements under Clause (i) of
sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025,
we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (hereinafter
referred to as the “Company”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Control
The respective Company’s management and Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over
financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the
Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference
to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to
Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are
companies incorporated in India.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial
Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors
of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to Consolidated
Financial Statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Accounting policy
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash
nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with
investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The
Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Overview and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Overview
1.1 Company overview
Infosys Limited ("the Company" or Infosys) provides
consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation
digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their
digital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a
sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of
clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and
generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to
be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on
their journey to a digital future.
Infosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is
hereinafter referred to as "the Group".
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and
domiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics city,
Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company
has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock
Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary
Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The Group's Consolidated financial statements are approved for
issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2025.

1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements
These Consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013
(''the Act''), guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI) and Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS)
under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for
certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values
and defined benefit liability/(asset) which is recognized at the
present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan
assets. The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act
read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except
where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted
or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a
change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material
accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited
consolidated financial statements have been discussed in
the respective notes.
As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded
to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous
quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures
reported in this statement.

1.3 Basis of consolidation
Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The
Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its
subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those
returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated
through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant
activities, those which significantly affect the entity's returns.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences
until the date control ceases.
The financial statements of the Group companies are
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances
and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such
transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial
statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies
in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent
part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries
that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the
Company, are excluded.
Refer to Note 2.25 for the list of subsidiaries and controlled
trusts of the Company

1.4 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates,
judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting
policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the period. The application of
accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates
involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of
assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed
in Note 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period
to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management
becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the
estimates. Changes in estimates and judgements are reflected
in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which
changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to
transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues
from customer contracts are considered for recognition and
measurement when the contract has been approved, in
writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract
are committed to perform their respective obligations under
the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group
assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies
distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of
distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables
and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from
such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these
distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.
313

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a
straight-line basis when services are performed through an
indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period.
Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized
ratably using a percentage of completion method when the
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer
and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the
period of the contract because the services are generally discrete
in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the
maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in
accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentageof-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual
efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated
total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended
have been used to measure progress towards completion as
there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The
estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment
and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect
any changes based on the latest available information.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or thirdparty vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services
arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from
sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of
costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer
and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for
the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether
it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they
are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it
is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the
specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and
other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods
or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
b. Income taxes
The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United
States, though the Company also files tax returns in other
overseas jurisdictions.
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision
for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid /
recovered for uncertain tax positions.
In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the
Management considers whether some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
the temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets
are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will
realize the benefits of those deductible differences.
314

The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered
realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if
estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward
period are reduced (Refer to Note 2.17).
c. Business combinations and intangible assets
Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103,
Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires us to fair value
identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration
to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are
conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required
to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration,
value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These
measurements are based on information available at the
acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions
that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to
Notes 2.1 and 2.4.2).
d. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion
of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic
depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an
asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at
the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's
assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset
is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial
year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar
assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact
their life, such as changes in technology (Refer to Note 2.2).
e. Impairment of Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and
whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a
Cash Generating Unit (CGUs) is less than its carrying amount. For
the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups
of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and
which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored
for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher
of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. Key assumptions
in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current
economic conditions and comprises estimated long term growth
rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating
margins (Refer to Note 2.4.1).

2. Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
2.1 Business combinations
Accounting policy
Business combinations have been accounted for using the
acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103,
Business Combinations.
The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at the fair value
of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date
on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price
also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent
consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date
and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount
of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of
subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
Business combinations between entities under common
control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's consolidated
financial statements.
The payments related to options issued by the Group over the
non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as
financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated
present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently
measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable
under the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable.
In the event that the option expires unexercised, the
liability is derecognized.
Acquisition
InSemi
On May 10, 2024, Infosys Limited acquired 100% voting interests
in InSemi Technology Services Private Limited, a semiconductor
design services company headquartered in India. This acquisition
is expected to strengthen our expertise in semiconductor
ecosystem and Engineering R&D services.
The purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based upon determination of fair values at the date of
acquisition as follows:

The purchase consideration of ₹198 crore includes cash of ₹168
crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value
of ₹30 crore as on the date of acquisition.
At the acquisition date, the key inputs used in determination of
the fair value of contingent consideration are the probabilities
assigned towards achievement of financial targets and discount
rate of 5.9%. The undiscounted value of contingent consideration
as of March 31, 2025 was ₹33 crore.
Additionally, this acquisition has retention bonus and
management incentive payable to the employees of the acquiree
over three years, subject to their continuous employment with
the Group and achievement of financial targets for the respective
years. Bonus and incentives are recognized in employee

The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value
of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill. The primary
items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired
assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which
qualify as an intangible asset.

Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly
attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property,
plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the
Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is
derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected
useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The
estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Buildings(1)

22-25 years
5 years

Plant and machinery(1)(2)

Goodwill is not tax-deductible.

over two to five years, subject to their continuous employment
with the Group and achievement of financial targets for the
respective years. Bonus and incentives are recognized in
employee benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss
over the period of service.

Leasehold improvements

Fair value of trade receivables acquired is ₹139 crore as of
acquisition date and as of March 31, 2025 the amounts are
substantially collected.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with
a business combination such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due
diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are
expensed as incurred. The transaction costs of ₹4 crore related
to the acquisition have been included under administrative
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the
quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the
useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the
Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for
these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of
Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013

(2)

Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are
reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The
useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets
as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their
life, such as changes in technology.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified
as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost
of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under
‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating
to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with these
will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or
retirement of the asset.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined
on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate
cash flows that are largely independent of those from other
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for
the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss
is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of

Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used
to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount
of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount,
provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined (net of any accumulated
depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the
asset in prior years.

The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2025 are as follows:

2.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets
2.4.1 Goodwill
Accounting policy
Goodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of
the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity.
When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration,
the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain
purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and
whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For
the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups
of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and
which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored
for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of
a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable
amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the
higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use.
Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected
to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow
projections are prepared based on current economic conditions
and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted
average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in
a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of
CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The
Group internally reviews the goodwill for impairment at the
operating segment level, after allocation of the goodwill to
CGUs or groups of CGUs.
The allocation of goodwill to operating segments as at
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

2.4.2 Intangible Assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization
and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their
respective individual estimated useful lives on a straightline basis, from the date that they are available for use. The
estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based
on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence,
demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the
stability of the industry, and known technological advances)
and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain
the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization
methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at
each financial year end.
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product
development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical
and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future
economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and
ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can
be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include
the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly
attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.
Impairment

The goodwill pertaining to Panaya amounting to ₹996 crore and
₹972 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively
is tested for impairment at the entity level.

Particulars

The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost
of Capital (WACC) of the Company. As at March 31, 2025, the
estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying
amount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to
cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of
the cash generating units.

Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment
testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair
value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an
individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash
flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In
such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to
which the asset belongs.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss
is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used
to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount
of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount,
provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined (net of any accumulated
amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the
asset in prior years.

2.11 Financial instruments
Accounting policy
2.11.1 Initial recognition
The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities
when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized
at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables
which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair
value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial
recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are
accounted for at trade date.
2.11.2 Subsequent measurement
a. Non-derivative financial instruments
(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost
A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost
if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold
the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the
contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVOCI)
A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through
other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model
whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for
certain investments which are classified as equity instruments
to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other
comprehensive income based on its business model.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through
profit or loss (FVTPL)
A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above
categories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost
using the effective interest method, except for contingent
consideration and financial liability under option arrangements
recognized in a business combination which is subsequently
measured at fair value through profit or loss.
b. Derivative financial instruments
The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign
exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of
changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The
counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.
(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value
through profit or loss.
This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities
which are not designated as hedges.
Although the Group believes that these derivatives constitute
hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify
for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments.
Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or
is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is
categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value
through profit or loss.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at
fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in
net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are
measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting
exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets/
liabilities in this category are presented as current assets/current
liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be
realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
(ii) Cash flow hedge
Primarily, the Group designates certain foreign exchange
forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate
the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable
forecast cash transactions.
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value
of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any
ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative
is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires
or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss
on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging
reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash
flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.

327

The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash
flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence
of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted
transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount
accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net
profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the
disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and
liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one
year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair
value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the
short maturity of these instruments.

2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments

The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit
loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue
which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance
for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant
financing component is measured at an amount equal to
lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at
an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a
significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which
case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

2.11.5 Impairment

The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual
rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or
it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for
derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a
part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's
Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is
discharged or cancelled or expires.
2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

The Group determines the allowance for credit losses
based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect
current and estimated future economic conditions. The
Group considers current and anticipated future economic
conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the
countries where it operates.

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments,
the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions
that are based on market conditions and risks existing at
each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair
value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing
model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and
dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in
general approximation of value, and such value may never
actually be realized.

The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss
allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required
to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, government securities,
non convertible debentures and tax-free bonds of
₹2,143 crore was transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of fair
value hierarchy, since these were valued based on quoted
price. Further, government securities of ₹73 crore were
transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since
these were valued based on market observable inputs.
A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs
used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not
have a significant impact in its value.
Majority of investments of the Group are fair valued based on
Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include
investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund
units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial
papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible
debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and
quasi-government organizations. The Group invests after
considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating,
Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per the
Group's risk management program.

Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks:
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's primary
focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets
and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial
performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign
exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments
to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Group's
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual
characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk
from the top few customers.

331

Market risk
The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the
business is transacted in several currencies and consequently
the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales
and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases
from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Group
holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange
forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes

in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is
also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany
transaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between
the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed
substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in
the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations
are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates/ depreciates
against these currencies.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group primarily holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk
of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative
financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or
indirectly observable in the marketplace.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the
Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and
option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of
foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash
transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in
cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2025 are expected to occur
and will be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss within three months.
The Group determines the existence of an economic
relationship between the hedging instrument and the
hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of
its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined
at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through
periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure
that an economic relationship exists between the hedged
item and hedging instrument, including whether the
hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash
flows of hedged items.
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no
longer optimal but the risk management objective remains

333

unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge
accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by
adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or
the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns
with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any
hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of the
hedge relationship rebalancing.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by
the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily
from trade receivables amounting to ₹31,158 crore and ₹30,193
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively and
unbilled revenues amounting to ₹15,083 crore and ₹14,548 crore
as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Trade
receivables and unbilled revenues are typically unsecured and
are derived from revenues from customers primarily located
in the United States of America and Europe. Credit risk has
always been managed by the Group through credit approvals,
establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the
creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit
terms in the normal course of business. The Group uses the
expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances;
and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit
loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This
matrix takes into account credit reports and other related credit
information to the extent available.

Share options outstanding account

Accounting policy

The share options outstanding account is used to record the fair
value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with
employees. The amounts recorded in share options outstanding
account are transferred to securities premium upon exercise of
stock options and transferred to general reserve on account of
stock options not exercised by employees.

Ordinary shares

costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares,
share options and buyback are recognized as a deduction from
equity, net of any tax effects.
Treasury shares
When any entity within the Group purchases the Company's
ordinary shares, the consideration paid including any directly
attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction
from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the
amount received is recognized as an increase in equity, and the
resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to /
from securities premium.

Description of reserves
Capital Redemption Reserve

the Company creates capital redemption reserve equal to the
nominal value of the shares bought back as an appropriation
from general reserve/retained earnings.
Retained earnings

As at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 2,88,384 and 2,91,795
cash settled options were outstanding respectively. The carrying
value of liability towards cash settled share based payments
was ₹18 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March
31, 2024 respectively.
The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes
Model for time and non-market performance-based options and
Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant,
exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected

term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility
during the expected term of the options is based on historical
volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's
publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to
the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the
comparative company have been modelled based on historical
movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity
shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of
the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between
each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each
entity in the peer group.

The fair value of each equity settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

The movement in the provision for post-sales client support is
as follows :

Accounting policy
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group
has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably
estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The Group
recognizes a reimbursement asset when, and only when, it is
virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received if the
Group settles the obligation.

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the
expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future
obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if
any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which
such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or
costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the
present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating
the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the
contract. Before a provision is established the Group recognizes
any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

Particulars

Provision for post-sales client support and other provisions
majorly represents costs associated with providing sales support
services which are accrued at the time of recognition of revenues
and are expected to be utilized over a period of 1 year.

The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period post sales
support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs
associated with such support services are accrued at the time
related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs
based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on
a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and
likelihood of occurrence.

Particulars

(In ₹ crore)

Accounting policy
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income
tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent
that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which
case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized
at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the
tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial
statements except when the deferred income tax arises from
the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a
transaction that is not a business combination and affects
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the
transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes
in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

recognized as income or expense in the period that includes
the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred
income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable profit will be available against which the
deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed
earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that
the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in
the foreseeable future.
The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities;
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts
and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The income
tax provision for the interim period is made based on the best
estimate of the annual average tax rate expected to be applicable
for the full financial year. Tax benefits of deductions earned on
exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation
charged to income are credited to equity.

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the year
ended March 31, 2025 is 25.17% and for the year ended March
31, 2024 was 34.94%.
Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March
31, 2024 includes provisions (net of reversals) of
₹132 crore and reversals (net of provisions) of ₹937 crore,
respectively. These provisions and reversals pertaining to prior
periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain
disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of
assessments, across various jurisdictions.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received
orders under section 250 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, from the
Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17
and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position
with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a
result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and
provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed
with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to
1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income Tax Act, 1961,
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment
of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pretax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognized and provision for income
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding
credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution
of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been
reduced from contingent liabilities.
The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable
overseas principally in the United States. In India, the Group has
benefited from certain tax incentives that the Government of
India had provided for export of software and services from the
units registered under the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Act,
2005 in the prior years. SEZ units which began the provision
of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction
of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services
for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit
commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits
or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains
is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a
Special Economic Zone re-Investment Reserve out of the profit
of the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the
Group for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose
of its business as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act,
1961. (Refer to Special Economic Zone Re-investment reserve
under Note 2.12 Equity)
Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2025 and
March 31, 2024 substantially relates to origination and reversal of
temporary differences.
Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to
the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater

345

than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the
year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code.
As at March 31, 2025, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to
approximately ₹7,755 crore. As at March 31, 2025, the Company
has a deferred tax liability for Branch Profit Tax of ₹271 crore (net
of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits
are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future
Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on
temporary differences amounting to ₹16,593 crore and ₹10,776
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively,
associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as
the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The
Group majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries
and branches only to the extent these can be distributed
in a tax-free manner.
Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on
accumulated losses of ₹4,597 crore and ₹4,668 crore as at
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, as it is probable
that future taxable profit will not be available against which the
unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future.

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the
management considers whether some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets
are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will
realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount
of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however,
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
income during the carry forward period are reduced.
The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired
in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and
currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best
estimate determined based on the expected value method.

2.18 Revenue from operations
Accounting policy
The Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising
software development and related services, cloud and
infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms
across the Group’s core and digital offerings (together called as
“software-related services”) and business process management
services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-andmaterial, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.
Revenues from customer contracts are considered for
recognition and measurement when the contract has been
approved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to
contract are committed to perform their respective obligations
under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised
products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has
received or expects to receive in exchange for these products
or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as
to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such
uncertainty is resolved.
The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and
identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.
The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct
348

performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling
price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold
separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price.
In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to
estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a
margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying
the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate
margin based on similar services.
The Group’s contracts may include variable consideration
including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group
includes variable consideration as part of transaction price
when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of
the variable consideration and when it is probable that a
significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable
consideration is resolved.
Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts,
are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straightline basis when services are performed through an indefinite
number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably
using a percentage of completion method when the pattern
of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and
the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the
period of contract because the services are generally discrete
in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price,
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations
are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentageof-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to
determine progress towards completion as there is a direct
relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards
completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to
date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs
or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts
are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and
are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates
change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the
estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the
contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on
incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such
losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs
to complete the contract.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic
performance based billing and / or milestone based progress
billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled
revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as
contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).
In arrangements for software development and related
services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue
recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation,
the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria
for considering software development and related services as
distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction
price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each
performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone
selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item
when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone
selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

the standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost
plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling
price. For software development and related services, the
performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services
are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the
work as it progresses.
Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include
multiple elements which may be subject to other specific
accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting
guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to
determine that hardware and services are distinct performance
obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance
obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the
absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected
cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone
selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a
single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over
the period and measure of progress is determined based on
promise in the contract.
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right
to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license
are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses
where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized
over the access period.
Arrangements to deliver software products generally have
three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical
Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in
conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license
and implementation have been identified as two distinct
separate performance obligations, the transaction price for
such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of
the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices.
In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation,
the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in
estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license
is required to be substantially customized as part of the
implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license
and implementation is considered to be a single performance
obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentageof-completion method as the implementation is performed.
Revenue from client training, support and other services arising
due to the sale of software products is recognized as the
performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized
ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the
services are rendered.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded
net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is
the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first
evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or
services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group
considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it
controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting
as a principal or an agent.
A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both
of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract.
A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct
performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate
contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone
selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and
creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone
selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct
performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing
contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs
that would not have been incurred if the contract had not
been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group
expects to recover them.
Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition
or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate
performance obligation are recognized as an asset when
such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate
or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in
satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are
expected to be recovered.
Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to
customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs
are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life
on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or
services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs
are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are
recorded when present value of projected remaining operating
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of
the capitalized costs.
The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2025 and

* Geographical revenue is based on the domicile of customer.

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for
the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is 54%
and 53%, respectively.
Trade receivables and contract balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections
results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue
on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed
as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual
terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or
upon achievement of contractual milestones.
The Group’s receivables are rights to consideration that are
unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess
of billings from time and material contracts and fixed price
maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when
the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only
after a passage of time.
Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on
milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of
revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to
the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price
contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset
because the right to consideration is dependent on completion
of contractual milestones.
Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of
impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.
During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the
Company recognized revenue of ₹5,669 crore and ₹5,432 crore
arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2024 and
April 1, 2023 respectively.

350

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024,
₹4,896 crore and ₹7,023 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining
to other fixed-price and fixed time-frame contracts as
of April 1, 2024 and April 1, 2023, respectively has been
reclassified to Trade receivables upon billing to customers on
completion of milestones.
Remaining performance obligation disclosure
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the
aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized
as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to
when the Group expects to recognize these amounts in revenue.
Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the
Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation
related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the
entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts
where invoicing is on time and material and unit of work based
contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic
revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized
and adjustments for currency fluctuations.
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are
completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2025, other
than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above,
is ₹1,04,785 crore. Out of this, the Group expects to recognize
revenue of around 50.3% within the next one year and the
remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance
obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at
March 31, 2024 is ₹90,658 crore. The contracts can generally
be terminated by the customers and typically includes an
enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally,
customers have not terminated contracts without cause.

2.19 Other income, net
Accounting policy
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend
income, gain/loss on investment and exchange gain/loss on
forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign
currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using
the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized
when the right to receive payment is established.
Foreign currency
Accounting policy
Functional currency
The functional currency of Infosys, its Indian subsidiaries and
controlled trusts is the Indian rupee. The functional currencies for
foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. These
financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded off
to crore; one crore equals ten million).

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Transactions and translations
Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities
are translated into the relevant functional currency at
exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains
or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and reported
within exchange gains/ (losses) on translation of assets and
liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive
Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets
and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency
and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate
prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Nonmonetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a
foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated
at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction.
The related revenue and expense are recognized using
the same exchange rate.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign
currency transactions are included in determining net profit
for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue,
expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the
exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.
The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries
to the presentation currency is performed for assets and
liabilities using the exchange rate in effect at the Balance Sheet
date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items using the
average exchange rate for the respective periods. The gains or
losses resulting from such translation are included in currency
translation reserves under other components of equity. When
a subsidiary is disposed off, in full, the relevant amount is
transferred to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss. However when a change in the parent's ownership
does not result in loss of control of a subsidiary, such changes are
recorded through equity.
Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation
differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at
fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as
financial instruments and measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVOCI).
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate in effect at
the Balance Sheet date.

on a systematic basis in net profit in the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them with
the related costs which they are intended to compensate.

2.21 Leases
Accounting policy
The Group as a lessee
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for
land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the
right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses
whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2)

352

the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use
of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has
the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes
a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability
for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases
with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and
low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the
Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
As a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the noncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend
or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably
certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease
term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is
reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the
contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group
considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements
undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination
of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to
Group’s operations taking into account the location of the
underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The
lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease
term reflects the current economic circumstances.
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably
certain that they will be exercised.
The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payments made at or prior to the commencement date of
the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives.
They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.
The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and
useful life of the underlying asset.
The ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing,
the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost
to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset
basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are
largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the
recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the
present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or,
if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing
rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related
ROU asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will
exercise an extension or a termination option.

substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee,
the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are
classified as operating leases.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in
the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as
financing cash flows.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its
interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The
sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference
to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.

The Group as a lessor
Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance
or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight
line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

2.22 Employee benefits
Accounting policy
Gratuity and pensions
The Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement
plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible employees majorly of
Infosys and its Indian subsidiaries. The Gratuity Plan provides a
lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death,
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount
based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of
employment with the Group. The Company contributes Gratuity
liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust
("the Trust"). In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions
are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust
and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust,
respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the
Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life
Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.
The Group operates defined benefit pension plan in certain
overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These
plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The plans
provide for periodic payouts after retirement and/or a lumpsum
payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death
and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require
contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that
varies depending on the age of the respective employees.
Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external
actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected
unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the
Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate
risk and market risk.
The Group recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit
plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses
through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability /
(asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed
by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect
of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Provident fund
Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and
the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary.
The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust invests in specific designated
instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government administered pension fund. The rate at
which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government of India. The Company has
an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate.
In respect of Indian subsidiaries, eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution plan. Both
the eligible employee and the respective companies make monthly contributions to this provident fund plan equal to a specified
percentage of the covered employee's salary. Amounts collected under the provident fund plan are deposited in a government
administered provident fund. The Companies have no further obligation to the plan beyond its monthly contributions.
Superannuation
Certain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Group has no further
obligations to the plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is
invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.
Compensated absences
The Group has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost
of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet
date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement
that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in
which the absences occur.

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered
as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government
bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2)

The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision
trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3)

Attrition rate considered is the management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been
considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of postemployment benefit obligation.

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions
regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance
with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation
of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions
regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to
the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and
other relevant data.
The Group assesses all of the above assumptions
with its projected long-term plans of growth and
prevalent industry standards.
The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards
gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust.
In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to
the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve
Systems Limited Employees Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively.
Trustees administer contributions made to the trust as at
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, and contributions for gratuity
are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation
of India as permitted by Indian law. The plan assets of the
overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in
insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is
determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under
the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and
provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.
Actual return on assets (including remeasurements) of the
gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31,
2024 were ₹173 crore and ₹145 crore, respectively and for the
pension plan were ₹79 crore and ₹36 crore, respectively.
The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the

2.22.2 Provident fund

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risk
which are set out below:
Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan
liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined
by reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas
jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond
yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the
defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund
offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump
sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for
converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that
the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates
and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return
implied by these conversion rates.
Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in
equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds
in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the
short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible
for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified
given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund
and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on
members’ account balances.

Infosys has an obligation to fund any shortfall on the yield of the
trust’s investments over the administered interest rates on an
annual basis. These administered rates are determined annually
predominantly considering the social and economic factors. The
actuary has provided a valuation for provident fund liabilities on
the basis of guidance issued by the Actuarial Society of India.
The following tables set out the funded status of the defined
benefit provident fund plan of Infosys Limited and the amounts
recognized in the Group's financial statements as at March 31,

2.23 Earnings per equity share
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net
profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of
the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares
considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also
the weighted average number of equity shares that could have
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity
shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at
fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity
shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted
as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently
for each period presented.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity
shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for
any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes
effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by
the Board of Directors.

The claims against the Group primarily represent demands
arising on completion of assessment proceedings under the
Income Tax Act, 1961. These claims are on account of issues of
disallowance of expenditure towards software being held as
capital in nature, payments made to Associated Enterprises held
as liable for withholding of taxes, among others. These matters
are pending before various Income Tax Authorities and the
Management including its tax advisors expect that its position
will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a
material adverse effect on the Group's financial position and
results of operations.
Amount paid to statutory authorities against the tax claims
amounted to ₹4,199 crore and ₹8,743 crore as at March 31, 2025

Accounting policy
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past
events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present
obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured
with sufficient reliability.

Particulars

2.24.1 Contingent liability

In November 2023, certain systems of Infosys McCamish
Systems LLC (“McCamish”), a subsidiary of Infosys BPM Limited
(a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infosys Limited), were encrypted
by ransomware, resulting in the non-availability of certain
applications and systems. McCamish initiated its incident
response and engaged cybersecurity and other specialists
to assist in its investigation of and response to the incident
and remediation and restoration of impacted applications
and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external
specialists’ assistance, substantially remediated and restored the
affected applications and systems. Actions taken by McCamish
included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party
cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether
and the extent to which the Company or customer data was
subject to unauthorized access or exfiltration. McCamish also
engaged a third-party eDiscovery vendor in assessing the extent
and nature of such data. McCamish in coordination with its thirdparty eDiscovery vendor has identified corporate customers
and individuals whose information was subject to unauthorized
access and exfiltration. McCamish processes personal data on
behalf of its corporate customers.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

From March 6, 2024 through July 25, 2024, six actions were filed
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
against McCamish. The actions arise out of the cybersecurity
incident at McCamish initially disclosed on November 3, 2023.
All six actions have since been consolidated, and the
consolidated class action complaint was filed on November
7, 2024, purportedly on behalf of all persons residing in the
United States whose personally identifiable information was
compromised in the incident, including all who were sent
a notice of the incident. On December 20, 2024, the Court
granted the parties’ joint motion to stay proceedings pending
the parties’ efforts to resolve the lawsuit through mediation.
On March 13, 2025, McCamish and the plaintiffs engaged in
mediation, resulting in an in-principle agreement that sets forth
the terms of a proposed settlement of the class action lawsuits
against McCamish, as well as seven class action lawsuits arising
out of the incident that have been filed against McCamish’s
customers. Under the settlement terms, McCamish has agreed
to pay $17.5 million (approximately ₹150 crore) into a fund to
settle these matters. The agreed terms are subject to finalization
of the terms of the settlement agreement, and preliminary
and final court approval. If approved, the settlement will
resolve all allegations made in the class action lawsuits without
admission of any liability.

McCamish has recorded an accrual of $17.5 million

has recognized an insurance reimbursement receivable of $17

and determined, will not have a material and adverse effect on

2.26 Segment reporting
Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the
way that public business enterprises report information about
operating segments and related disclosures about products
and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The
Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-toend business solutions to enable clients to enhance business
performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)
evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based
on an analysis of various performance indicators by business
segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along
business segments. The accounting principles used in the
preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied
to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and
are as set out in the accounting policies.
Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in
Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing,
enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics,
enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services,
enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media,
enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare
and all other segments. The Financial services reportable
segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services
operating segment and Finacle operating segment because
of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other
segments represent the operating segments of businesses
in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other
enterprises in Public Services.

372

Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to
segments are categorized based on items that are individually
identifiable to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments'
represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and
revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan
and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated
expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering
services from the Group's offshore software development
centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in
relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain
expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form
a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically
allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are
used interchangeably.
The Management believes that it is not practical to provide
segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses,
and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as
"unallocated" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.
Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not
identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used
interchangeably between segments. The Management believes
that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures
relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful
segregation of the available data is onerous.
Business segment revenue information is collated based on
individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue
is otherwise recognized.
Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note
2.18, Revenue from operations.

7. Members may note that the Board, at its meeting held on April 17, 2025, has recommended a final dividend of ₹22 per equity share
for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. The record date for the purpose of final dividend is May 30, 2025. The final dividend, once
approved by the members in the ensuing AGM, will be paid on June 30, 2025, through various modes. To avoid delay in receiving

with the Company’s Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) (where shares are held in physical mode) to receive the dividend directly into
their bank account on the payout date.
8. Members may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend paid or
distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be required
to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final dividend. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS
rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in accordance with
the provisions of the IT Act.
For resident shareholders, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows:

*

As per Section 139AA of the IT Act, every person who has been allotted a PAN and who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, shall be required to link the PAN with
Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative and he shall be liable to all consequences under
the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as provided in section 206AA of the IT Act, 1961 i.e., 20% of tax deduction at source.

However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to resident individual shareholders if the total dividend to be received by
them during financial year 2025-2026 does not exceed ₹10,000 and also in cases where members provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form
15H is applicable to resident individual shareholders aged 60 years or more), subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident
shareholders may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / nil withholding of tax. PAN is
mandatory for members providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above.
For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 and other
applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge
and cess) or as notified by the GOI on the amount of dividend payable. However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non‑resident
shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), read with
Multilateral Instrument (MLI), between India and the country of tax residence of the shareholders, if they are more beneficial to them.

Notes

Notice of the 44th Annual General Meeting | 13

(1)

In order to leverage efficiencies of scale and optimize the resources available in the group, resources are shared within the group. Accordingly, purchase, sale of services and shared services majorly includes transfer
of manpower, sharing of business enabling services like Finance & Accounting, Legal Support, Purchase & Facility Management, Human Resource Management Services, Risk Management, Information Security,
Management Support, software license and other administrative services.

(2)

Transactions between the Stater entities in the Netherlands (HypoCasso B.V.; Stater XXL B.V.; Stater Nederland and Stater N.V.) are generally on a cost basis as all these entities are under a tax group and file a single
tax return. The transactions between other subsidiaries are either on a cost-sharing or cost-plus-markup basis depending on the respective local regulations on transfer pricing. All transactions are at arm’s length
basis.

(3)

As a part of an ongoing program of entity rationalization, the Company may from time to time propose merger / demerger of entities within the Group. These mergers are generally based on the local regulatory
requirements and are accounted for as transactions under common control under the relevant accounting standards.

(4)

Equity infusion by Stater N.V. is to strengthen subsidiary operational capabilities.

(5)

Key financial information of each of the subsidiaries is available in annexure 1 to the boards report forming part of this annual report

(6)

Percentage is calculated based on the standalone turnover of Stater N.V.
